	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>We look at someone's work to learn about the work, or to understand the person. Traditional portfolios are bad for the latter. This is an attempt at describing my work as a journey, so you can understand the professional me better. This also shows how I developed from one project into the next. And most importantly, this was built to be enjoyable to use.</p>
	<h3>Tech</h3>
	<p>I chose to just use jquery + DOM elements for all the interactive bits here. I considered a canvas engine, but decided that events were more useful to me than pixel-precise positioning. I actually like CSS as a visual tool over coding math for 2D stuff.</p>
