		<p>Swarm Combat is a web-based asynchronous multiplayer strategy game where
		the players design a set of instructions for their swarm drones to execute
		when they enter the battlefield against the opponent's drones. You can watch 
		completed battles on the site.
		</p>
		<p>When we wanted to form a game studio, we signed up for the 
		<span class="highlight">Mozilla Game Jam 2013</span> to see how well we'd work together under a deadline, 
		while also remote (my teammate was in Boston while I was in Berkeley).</p>
		<p>Building for the web, which is a platform that we were both learning
		as we went along, we were able to secure <a href="https://gameon.mozilla.org/en-US/entries/swarm-combat/">Notable Runner-Up</a> in
		the division we were vying for (Hackable Games).</p>
		<p>Related: <a href="zoako.html">Zoako Studios</a> was formed immediately after this.</p>
