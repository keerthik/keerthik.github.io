"It's not like I have a raging burning passion of lust for you. It's just that I can't imagine being happier spending the rest of my life with anyone else I know, or could even dream up."

"It's because it's not a question of not being able to get you out of my head, or being head over heels. It's just that no matter which direction I think about it from, it makes no sense for me to try and be with anyone but you."

"I don't think I did a good job of conveying how big a deal this is to me. If you ever take the chance with me, I'm not here on an experimental "let's see what will happen." I mean it'll be forever. I haven't been able to say that to anyone else. And it's a no-brainer to me when it comes to you. You are basically the most important person to me outside of my family, and turns out you have been for a long time."

"Remember how I told you I learned about what I wanted and made me happy over the last year of being mostly on my own. I can keep myself busy and happy quite well now."



"Certainly I want you to keep going ahead and doing what you feel you need to and is right. It sounds cheesy, I really do just want you to be happy."
