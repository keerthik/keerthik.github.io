		Operation Dicestorm is a unique board-game that we are aiming to 
		<span class="highlight">crowdfund</span> for our first release
		in 2016.
		</p>		
		<p> The design focuses on providing different levels of gameplay
		depth for different players. We do this by emphasizing three
		factors to performance - <span class="highlight">strategy, dexterity
		and chance</span> - which are intricately interwoven.
		</p>
		</p>		
		<p> Iterations of the game has been playtested with <span class="highlight">over 100 players</span> as of November 2014.
		Over <span class="highlight">40 of them have subscribed for updates from our Facebook page</span>. And several of them
		have expressed interest in buying our prototype versions off us when we playtested with them!
