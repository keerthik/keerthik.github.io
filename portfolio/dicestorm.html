		Operation Dicestorm is a unique board-game that we are aiming to 
		<span class="highlight">crowdfund</span> for our first release
		in 2015.
		</p>		
		<p> The design focuses on providing different levels of gameplay
		depth for different players. We do this by emphasizing three
		factors to performance - <span class="highlight">strategy, dexterity
		and chance</span> - which are intricately interwoven.
		</p>
		<p>
		The game is heavily reliant on its physical aspect, making it
		nearly impossible to recreate digitally. This encourages people to
		play it face-to-face, the true form in which board games were meant
		to be enjoyed!</p>
