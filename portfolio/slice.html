		Slice is one of the earliest music discovery apps for Android built as part of Olin's second

		Slice uses <span class="highlight">the EchoNest music API</span> to do the
		similarity detection, and Play.me as the music provider for the audio library.
		The app is now defunct as we did not pursue a new music provider when Play.me
		shut down their agreements with all major record labels.
