		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Core team members: 4; 
			February 2007</span>
		<p>
		Olin College focuses on hands-on learning and human-centric design.
		One of our first challenges as engineering students was to create 
		<span class="highlight">a biologically inspired toy swimmer that 4th graders would enjoy</span>.
		</p>		
		<p>
		Our team picked the adorable <span class="highlight">emperor penguins</span> for inspiration.
		</p>
		</p>		
		<p>
		After prototyping numerous swimming penguin mechanics, I pitched
		<span class="highlight">a no-moving-parts design that was meant to be used like a torpedo</span> to the team.
		Because of the design simplicity of our idea, we were able to build an entire fleet of penguins and
		props for a game/challenge targetted at the fourth-graders that would evaluate our project. We were the only
		team that was able to provide a social playing experience for the kids, a "penguin race". We did not let the
		engineering challenge get in the way of pursuing what's important at the end of the day (at least to me), 
		which was to build an enjoyable, informative and emotional experience for our users.
