It's happened. I'm officially one of those "good ol' days" people, at the ripe old age of 34.

I hate how we exist online: a stream of isolated thought-bytes (and thot-bytes) taken out of context and embedded in an algorithmically knitted tapestry from across our acquaintances, crushes, IRL celebrities, tapestry-celebrities and "I-don't-remember-why-I-started-following-them"s.

When I was 13, I wanted nothing more than to exist entirely online. Sadly, our dialup internet cost 200bz per hour â€” about $0.85/hr in 2023 money, not accounting for the economic disparity between the US, and Oman where I grew up. Combined with my parents' dictatorial restriction of 90 minutes of computer time a week (regardless of the aforementioned financial consideration, a story for another time), I had to sadly exist **extremely** offline until I moved out at 18.

Since then, I have been mired in the same boggy quicksand as everyone else and their mother (definitely *my* mother, at least) of feeding the endless feeds with my posts, scrolling the infinite scrolls with my time, and eyeballing the ads with my, well, eyeballs. I hated most of the experience: being full of hope (for what?) when posting; getting that dopamine hit when I noticed a notification; realizing it means nothing real; still being unable to control my body from clicking on it, and then refreshing a few times in case it went up again; disagreeing with all the other out-of-context thoughtbytes; expressing said disagreement.

Occasionally the social media walled-gardens \*cough\* prisons \*cough\* would parole me to an oasis like a wonderfully passionate personal blog or interesting project on a personal site. And I am hit with a wave of relief and joy, faintly nostalgic in flavor, like feeling an ocean spray from the beach I grew up next to. I feel like I am engaging with a *human being*, simultaneously next to me but also infinitely far away, as I see not just a disembodied thought, but the contexts within which those thoughts were formed.
