Focus effort on design for custom game cards, reducing overhead and repeat work

# Icons
Create a class for each icon type. Editing the base class should reflect changes everywhere

# Text
Create a style for every type of text. Modifying the base type should reflect changes everywhere

# Template
Cards have a base template. All items are positioned relative to its features. Modifying the template should reflect changes in all cards and realign contents accordingly.
