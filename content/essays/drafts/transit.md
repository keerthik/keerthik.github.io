## What Transit Means To Me

A lot more than I thought it did, is what it is. AKA, a love letter to [New Urbanist Memes for Transit Oriented Teens]().

## Medellin

Medellín is truly a magical place. The history of how the city turned from one of the most dangerous places in the world to one of the safest cities in Colombia is amazing. And its metro system played a huge part in it. 
Medellín Metro is deeply respected by the local Paisa people. Ask them to show you the city and they would take you on a tour of the metro system. The metro system is a symbol of the city's economic development. Paisa people would refrain from any rule breaking behavior, from stealing to jumping turnstiles, graffiti or holding the door open while it departs.

Cable cars are also used as a public transport to connect the city's least developed neighborhoods to the center.  The cable cars are necessary because the majority of the lower income people live on the hills, where roads often don't reach. The ideology behind this is that everyone, no matter which part of the city they live in, should always be connected through public transportation. 
As the slogan for Metro de Medellín goes, public transport here is "calidad de vida".
