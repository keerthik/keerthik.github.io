# Vision vs Innovation
Innovation is a word that has been overused so heavily that it has begun to lose all meaning 
Innovation is the process of coming up with an unforeseen solution to a familiar problem
Vision is having an unforeseen idea for how the world can be such that it no longer has a familiar problem

To the innovator, the ideal user flow is
  problem > frustration > existing solution > slightly less problem > better solution > minimal problem

To the visionary, the ideal user flow is
  no problem because this is no longer a problem in the world they have created

Visionary innovative
