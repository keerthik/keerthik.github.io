# Things I've written

> ðŸš§ While I'm migrating to Hugo, my old essays may be inaccessible ðŸš§.

Sometimes I write things, very slowly. I think everyone could [write more](1408_introwriting), even if like me, they don't see themselves as a writer.

Latest piece: [switching to hugo](2305_switchinghugo)

## Keep Up

I will eventually spin up a mailing list here.
