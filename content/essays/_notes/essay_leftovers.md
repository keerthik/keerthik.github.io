## 2009_compensation

I began writing this for versions of myself from alternate timelines, had a few things turned out differently in the world in the years following my graduation from college, or at BitGym, the business I am cofounder of.

Between being pushed away from VC-funded startup culture in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, to being forced to adopt a fully distributed work culture since 2013 due to immigration woes, this version of me got to experience and grow with a unique set of work circumstances for a *long* time and build resilience to what used to be a unique class of challenges. Which happened to be nearly ideal preparation for what a lot more people now must also experience in 2020, especially with the cascading impacts of COVID-19 on work and the economy, and the gaping weaknesses in our traditional ideologies it has revealed.

## Where am I coming from?
My experience is being cofounder of a very small (6 full-time as of today), fully distributed company, founded and primarily based in America. We are (almost purely) in the consumer software industry, where the geographic location of an individual contributor approaches irrelevance. I think it shouldn't be that different for a lot of organizations, but in a few cases the location of an employee can significantly affect their impact, and the expected impact should always be the prime determinant of their compensation.

Most of these thoughts and guidelines do not apply to non-payroll contributors, such as contractors and freelancers. These people have hourly rates, and may not necessarily be tasked with the same kind of long-term choices and work.
