future of money

- BitCoin gets a lot of hype
- If it becomes a defacto currency, the exchange rates won't matter
- Prices of goods/services can fluctuate like the exchange rate, but they will be transparent
- There are no processing entities (necessarily) involved, allowing tiny transactions or huge transactions for free
- There are no geographic or governing entites involved, allowing tiny transactions or huge transactions, globally for free

Risks
- Circumventing government and having no governing institution that can be monitored by government opens up all kinds of money laundering
-
