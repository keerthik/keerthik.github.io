In the modern era, gamers demand their Game Is Balanced. The biggest taboo a popular game can make is when one "tool" or combination turns out to be significantly more potent than others. This has obvious ramifications in competitive multiplayer games. But even for single player games, players get pretty invested in any statistically significant discrepancy in end-results from options that are presented as equals. "Busted" or "garbage" are equally unfun for players, even when there isn't a human opponent inflicting this imbalance upon them. 

## The ROI axis
The simplest balancing axis is the cost-benefit analysis, or "ROI" of employing the tool — where a tool is a unit, item, ability, mechanic, or combination thereof. I like to think of the ROI axis as a multi-variable polynomial equation, where the LHS represents "investment" or costs to the player, and the RHS represents "return" or benefits to their playthrough. Take, for instance an RPG like Torchlight or Fallout, and the tool in question is a generic weapon you can buy from a store.

## The object properties term
Generally, there are several costs associated with obtaining such a weapon that you can see when trying to obtain it: the money cost, the weilding stats requirements, encumberance & inventory space taken. On the flip side, you have the stats associated that determine its potency: damage, range, speed, dual-wielding flexibility, stat buffs, target debuffs/elemental properties, and other special abilities. These are the things I think are best balanced with a spreadsheet: items meant to be weak, should be cheap; items meant to be powerful, 'spency.

## The system interaction term
Less obviously, there are costs associated that are inherent to the game's design, rather than displayed on screen: how far into the game you have to get to access it, how easily you can reach a shop to access it, or how likely you will get such an item from random loot drops without needing to find a shop. Similarly, there are also benefits emergent from the game's design, like how many other tools (character classes, weapons, items, or abilities) synergize with it, how many enemies are vulnerable to it, or how the weapon scales with the changing challenges as the game progresses from the point of acquiring it. This stuff can be shoehorned into a spreadsheet, but typically is handled with statistical analysis of numerous playthoughs: look at the success and failure rate, the correlations between adoption and various player performance benchmarks at the intended stages of the game, and see that tool efficacy is in line with their intent: tools are effective where they're supposed to be good, tools are weak where they're supposed to be weak.

## The experiential term






the resource cost to produce it, the time to produce it, the tech tier level to access production of the unit — the "investment" — to even access the unit, let alone get any utility from it. Once accessed, the unit has several stats associated that determine its potency: movement speed, damage, range, HP, and special abilities or traits to provide utility, or "returns". For the moment, let's say our hypothetical RTS game's design has set aside special abilities, as that would require its own cost-benefit analysis that would be nested within and complicate that of individual units.
