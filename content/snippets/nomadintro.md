*In December 2013, I left San Francisco to begin my life as a digital nomad. For the next 2 years, I lived out of [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/komanakuttan?s=8) listings, mostly in Asia, while I continued to work remotely for my startup, [BitGym](http://www.bitgym.com).*

*That time has changed the way I see and interact with cities forever. When I donâ€™t go out much or find the town's vibe discouraging, I lose my sense of drive and purpose. On the other hand, being in a city filled with life, vigor and passion boosts my motivation, energy and happiness.*
