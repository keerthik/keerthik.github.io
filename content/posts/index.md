# Things I've written

Sometimes I write things, very slowly. They span a wide range of topics. I may link the same thing in a couple places. 

Here's my thoughts [about writing](introwriting.html)

Latest piece: [place-people](cities.html)

## <a name="nomadchronicles"></a>Cities: Nomad Chronicles
I didn't think I'd write about this much. However, being a nomad became a significant part of my identity and [cities became my closest friends](cities.html) so I talk about it now -- a lot.

- [place-people](cities.html)
- [zetsubou and i](zetsubou.html)
- [where are you from?](fromwhere.html)
- [language where you live](languageliving.html)
- [out of place](whatido.html)
- [eyes around us](eyes.html)

There are better resources for facts and tips about specific cities, I recommend [nomadList](nomadlist.io) by fellow nomad [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio).

## <a name="play"></a>Play

I talk a lot about game design, occasionally about other things game-related.

- [overpowered](overpowered.html)
- [toys -> games](toys.html)
- [fun vs anti-fun](antifun.html)
- [real game lessons](gamelessons.html)

## <a name="learning"></a>Learning

I think a lot about education. Surprisingly often I'm torn between placing a post here or above in Play, because I talk about games + education a lot.

- [the right problems](rightproblems.html)
- // problem-solving and games
- // languages
- // history


## Tech and Product

Entrepreneurial stuff, product ideas, technology and programming-related talk.

- [[scripting] one-touch android USB modem](android_modem.html)
- [working at early-stage](startupsymptoms.html)
- // extensible android video

## Meta: About Writing, the World, and Life

My favourite thoughts about the all other things I think about, usually in tiled rooms with running water.

- [personal health](health.html)
- [hello, writing](introwriting.html)
- [where are you from?](fromwhere.html)
