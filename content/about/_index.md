# kOrc.me

I develop software where needed, but am mostly figuring out how to evoke a sense of enjoyment through things I make. I care about games, learning, and creation.

## Contact

I am best reached by email. Hit me up at `keerthiko[at]gmail[dot]com` or on social.

Cold emails work. I love to meet/mentor people who may be interested in what I know or would like to collaborate. I follow a [maker's schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and prefer in-person, timeboxed to other media.

### Geography
I was born in picturesque Thiruvananthapuram, in south India. I grew up in quaint Muscat, Oman. I went to college in Boston, then moved to the bay area as employee #1 of BitGym, which I ended being a cofounder of through a major pivot.

I was forced to be a digital nomad [December 2013 - August 2015](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zQyPQn7ohRmA.kUSGhXjsO2xM) due to the wonderful machinations of US immigration -- I lived out of {{ site.abnb }} listings around Asia while I mostly wrote code as a cofounder through bouts of depression.

After wrangling an O1 and eventually a green card I was based in SF city [2015 - 2019], but find myself outside the country about a third of the year by choice.

## This site

This site primarily houses my [long-form writing](/essays). I am a fledgling writer, so bear with me. 

`// TODO: defunct while my hugo migration is WIP`.
This site secondarily serves as an index of my [projects] and prototypes of web apps and toys.

### History

**2007 - 2009**: I first made a long-form blog site on Wordpress with a few plugins from the wild.

**2009 - 2010**: I switched to tumblr for easier access to modifying site-wide HTML, CSS, js, etc.

**2010 - 2014**: While learning Ruby on Rails, hosted my own code on heroku. I developed the fascination while taking a class at Olin college that introduced me with modern back-end development.

**2014 - 2023**: After sufficient familiarity with front- and back-end webdev, I decided static sites are the way to go. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) became my weapon of choice, and I still happily vouch for it. I started working on this while nomad-ing in Thailand. There was a [pretty chill coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) going on there at the time of this writing (May/June 2014).

**2023 - present**: I decided I shall be [switching to hugo](/essays/2305_switchinghugo) as part of an overall website refresh.
