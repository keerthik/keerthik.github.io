Personal website
=========

Source for personal home page: keerthik.github.io

Mostly just HTML, CSS, occasional .js

Made with Jekyll

# Active TODO:
- image import partial for blog (and actual images)
- self-rolled basic analytics (referrer, viewcount)
- blog next/previous (really tho?)
