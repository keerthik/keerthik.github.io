# Toys -> Games
<div class="essay-date"><span class="essay-map">[DRAFT MODE] Last Updated:</span> June 2014</div>

Many people we know think they have a "great game idea" and then casually spout a crappy boring game concept. When someone actually pays attention to them, evaluates the idea, and points out several flaws in a minute, they just go "yeah well but it will be really fun!" and proceed to divert the conversation.

## A Simple Test
Something helpful to improve these conversations is to have a quick and simple test to quickly evaluate if your idea _can_ be a really fun game. "Toys -> Games" is a concept I use that is very powerful for this.

## What Is Toys -> Games?
Toys -> Games is the concept that a great toy makes the best kind of foundation for a great game. To understand this better, we need to describe what a game and what a toy is. Much of this is borrowed from Jesse Schell's wonderful book "The Art of Game Design."

What is a Game? A game is a system with rules and well-defined interactions where all players are aiming to attain certain objective goals. Some characteristics of games:
* There's a concept of doing well or badly
* There's a feedback loop of tasks and rewards
* You can "win" or "lose"

A good game provides a challenge while rewarding mastery.

Then what is a Toy? A toy is fundamentally a concept or object that is intended to be fun to interact with given no pre-existing instruction. Characteristics of a toy:
* Primarily based around physical interaction
* No pre-existing knowledge expected
* No sense of winning or losing
* No rules

A good toy is extremely fun to interact with even when there is no prescribed objective goal to be obtained. Often players focus their play around goals they come up with themselves.

## Some Case Studies
Very often, children treat toys as toys when they're younger. As they get older, they revive some of the same toy concepts by building games around them to unlock challenges and rewards. 
### The Slinky
[A classic household toy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinky) 

So satisfying to shuffle the ends from one hand to another, making it leapfrog, making it hop down stairs. There's no instruction manual on how to play with it, or what not to do with it. As kids grow older, they make competitive games like "How many steps can you go down", etc.

### LEGO's
There's some ambiguity because of the breadth of what LEGOs include.

### Rubik's Cube 
This one is more ambiguous.

## Video Game Toys
Video games, as the name suggests, are almost always games. There are a few 'toys' (Minecraft, Sim City) by the classification above that are considered video games, and a lot of toys that are thinly coated with a game layer (Tycoon, The Sims) to give a sense of doing well and doing badly.

But what's more important is being able to identify the core toy in any game, or a part of a game. Usually, the core toy = 
* the primary control scheme +
* the immediate gameplay effects it results in +
* rest of the feedback loop to inform the player of those effects +
* regardless of \[insert game objective\] wherever possible

Let's break down the implications of each of those further.

### Control Scheme
* Physical: How tiring is it for your fingers to rest over these keys? Do you have to use the mouse too? Is activity balanced between left and right hands? Can you reach all controls easily? If not, is it more fun to learn to reach all of them effectively?
* Focus: Is the focus on reflexes? Careful feathering for fine tuned controls? Timing? Speed? Each control needs to have a focus
* Reason: Does a control actually have a reason to exist -- ie, you actually use it regularly, yet it's not something you want held down all the time?

### Gameplay Effect
* Intuitive: The link between your physical control and the gameplay effect should be obvious
* Mechanic-centric: The gameplay effect should affect the system of the game in a meaningful way 
\[eg: moving a character is meaningful, changing the color of its name less so. The latter could however be a cosmetic option hotkey, but it's unlikely to be a fun control of the game you'll find players tapping with joy.\]

### Feedback
* Informative: effectively tell the player what he just asked for
* Responsive: quickly let the player know it worked
* Satisfying: graphic and sound effects play the main role here

### Regardless Of
You should be able to say the above is fun _regardless_ of relevant core objectives of the "game" you're considering. Sprinting around, wall-running and backflipping in Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is fun _regardless of_ really trying to go anywhere. 

### Need For Example
For example, let's consider the toy core of Need For Speed on PC (controls layout on a consoles is a moot point, since that's taken into account in controller design).
The primary control scheme is
* Left, Right > Turn (fine-tune focus)
* Up, Down > Accelerate, Brake (timing focus)

The arrow grid is a tried and tested, simple, easy and natural arrangement of keys for players. 

It does get a little tiring to hold down the accel. However you often need to let it go to control your speed in turns, and thus has a reason to exist. Mastering the timing of controlling your accel and braking is fun. Mastering the ability to tune how much to turn is fun. In general, mastering these controls to truly command the car to go how you want is fun. _Regardless of_ whether you're winning your race, or even going in the right direction. 

Smoke from the turning wheels on pavement, motion blur, screeching tires and revving engine sounds round off the feedback loop, making the core of NFS -- a "racing game" -- a fun toy. 


### Fascinating sidenotes
* A lot of fun core toys are inspired by fun real-world interactions, such as driving a real car being fun, inspiring racing games.
* the control scheme concept is why playing musical instruments is enjoyable. Combined with what I just mentioned, this is why Guitar Hero and Rock Band are so popular.
* usually, being able to do more things with fewer controls in an intuitive way is preferable -- for example, platform games use \[jump\] + \[right\] = \[leap right\] rather than assigning 3 separate keys for \[leap left\], \[jump up\] and \[leap right\]. It's interesting to note that this wasn't always the case, and is a non-trivial development that seems blindingly obvious today.
* Asteroids would be a lot more fun for many people with firing "always on" being an optional setting, given how many people just hold down the fire button for their entire play time.

## 1 Great Toy -> N Great Games
The fundamental thesis of Toys -> Games is that if you start by focusing on building a great toy, you create a fertile ground for a great game. However, most games have a threshold of how long they can enthrall a player. However, if your toy is flexible enough, when players are bored of your original game, there's still opportunity for more games around it. A great example is the Slinky above. 

This is pretty popular and effective in the world of video games. Look at the WarCraft III engine + map editor. Blizzard built some great toys with the RTS hero concept, ability templates, map editor, game interface and controls. The campaign is a game, the ladder is a game. When the community had pretty much exhausted them, the custom games built around the core toy of WC3 started pouring in, and boy did they create some great \*cough\* DOTA \*cough\* games. All because Blizzard started with a great toy.

Nintendo is famously known for starting most of their game concepts with "great controls." The point is if you have controls that feel good, the game is very likely to be sound.

In fact, this can effectively be extended to the creation of many core genres -- how good the controls feel. The popular genres built around a strong core toy: 
* FPS: moving and shooting from first-person perspective. Emphasis on accurate and fast control with a mouse or joystick \[almost like aiming with a real gun\]
* RTS: managing many tasks across different places on a system that all works together. Combination of precise mouse usage and high throughput, well-timed keyboard action \[almost like playing a musical instrument while also drawing pictures\]
* Racing: sense of speed, feather-able controls with tight feedback loops. Simple controls with an emphasis on finely tuned control with great responsiveness \[almost like driving a real car\]

Forget video games. A bouncy ball! The number and scale of sports and games humans have created from a spherical object with an amount of bounce is kind of mind-boggling. All because the ball is an amazing toy.

## More Uses
I use Toys -> Games to sometimes come up with new game ideas -- either starting from an established toy concept I like, or getting inspired when I come across a fun action to do.

It's also a good way to pinpoint the cause of frustrations players may have with a game's design. Strip away the game objectives (mentally at least) and play. Is it a decent toy? If it isn't, you have a fundamental problem with the controls and how it affects your game world.
