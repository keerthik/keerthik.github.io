	<p>
		I am fairly mediocre at essay-writing. I aim to get better. With each piece, I aim to improve a facet of my writing. Here is a list of things I've worked on, the top item what I'm currently striving for:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write a coding-centric post [incomplete]</li>
		<li>Write a game-centric post</li>
		<li>Reduce usage of (parentheses)</li>
		<li>Say more with less</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I am not really an authority on any of the things I talk about. I hope to be, someday.</p> 
	<p>In the meantime, maybe I have thought of aspects you didn't consider yet. I would be happy if this were of some value to you.</p>
