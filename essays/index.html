<h1>Things I've written</h1>
<p>
An intro: <a href="introwriting.html">Hello, Writing</a> [Pinned] <br>

Sometimes I write things, very slowly. They span a wide range of topics. I may link the same thing in a couple places. If you like what you read, consider following me on Twitter.

<h2>Play</h2>
<p>I talk a lot about game design, occasionally about other things game-related.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="toys.html">toys -> games</a></li>
	<li><a href="antifun.html">fun vs anti-fun</a></li>
	<li><a href="gamelessons.html">real game lessons</a> [draft]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>I think a lot about education. Surprisingly often I'm torn between placing a post here or above, because I talk about games + education a lot.</p>
<ul>
	<li>// problem-solving and games</li>
	<li>// languages</li>
	<li>// history</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech and Product</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurial stuff, product ideas, technology and programming-related talk.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="android_modem.html">[scripting] one-touch android USB modem</a></li>
	<li><a href="startupsymptoms.html">working at early-stage</a></li>
	<li>// extensible android video</li>
	<li>// extending android video with audio</li>
	<li>// remote work: the good, bad, ugly</li>
	<li>// dev environments suck</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travel Log</h2>
<p>
	I originally didn't think I'd write about this. However, being a nomad has unintentionally become a significant part of my identity and my life, 
	so it would be weird for it to not have it's own category. Ones tagged with [log] more time/place/event specific. 
	Posts tagged [review] will talk about fuzzy feelings and vibes, less about hard facts 
	(there are other resources for that, I recommend <a href="nomadlist.io">nomadList</a>)

<h2>Meta: About Writing, the World, and Life</h2>
<p>My favourite thoughts about the all other things I think about out, usually in tiled rooms with running water.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="introwriting.html">hello, writing</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Drafts</h2>
<p>Unfinished writing, feel free to peruse for whatever reason. I keep tabs on the analytics of these drafts to get a sense for what's getting interest, to flesh out</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="lightcolors.html">light and colors</a> [draft]</li>
	<li><a href="lifehacks.html">my lifehacks</a> [draft]</li>
	<li><a href="shouldexist.html">why don't these exist?</a> [draft]</li>
</ul>
