About half the days during my nomadism were spent without speaking on any personal level to another human being in meatspace. Sometimes by choice, yet many times it was rather inevitable given my circumstances much of that time -- my work was on isolated tasks that I had full ownership over, confined to my laptop. I would fly into a city where I knew literally noone, and plan to stay for 1-3 months. About half the places I lived in I couldn't speak the language at all. Other times I intentionally avoided human contact from the exhaustion of going through reintroducing myself and making the same distant small talk with each transient encounter. After such a stint when I would thank a store clerk or place an order at a restaurant I would find my own voice strange and unfamiliar because of how little I had heard it lately.

During these days, I came to realize there was always one reliable source of company and comfort (outside of my ever-present internet relationships) -- the city itself.

## Place-people

My friends were often surprised that my next leg was going to be 3 months in a city without a single personal contact, let alone a close friend. At first this was probably because I didn't know what I was doing, or had some simplistic approach to choosing a destination like "I hear Seoul has really good internet." Later on I relished the prospect when I found my response to my friends' incredulousness:

> I'm not alone *in* this city -- I'm alone *with* this city. 

I discovered that almost everything I saw, did and experienced while there was not just me in a vacuum. If you've traveled alone without much of a schedule, you'll know what I'm talking about. When I was out and about, the city suggested activities, provided the sights, and presented me with food options, which I proceeded to choose from. I now refer to this consciousness the "place-person" or "city-person" (I usually only hang out with city-people), and I call many of my interactions in and around town "conversing with the city."

This is easiest when alone with a city, but at times I consciously converse with cities even when with other humans. Just like with people, the conversation can range from apparently minor things to grand topics, and there's no telling which will prove to be more profound and meaningful. 

## The little things
I love the quaint little things cities tell me in our conversations. What are traffic expectations -- can you jay walk with nary a disapproving look? Sometimes if you *don't* jaywalk people click their tongues at you! How people are willing to approach you for charitable causes. 

## Grand topics
I have a hard time talking about cities without circling back to Paul Graham's excellent essay on [cities and ambition](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html). His essay covers what I consider the grand topics of conversation you can have with a city. 

TL;DR, cities suggest and inform your ambitions and supports your passions with all the subtle messaging: Paris loves you as an artist. New York can commisserate on your desire for money. Silicon Valley goads you to acquire more power. LA encourges you to seek fame. This is on the grander end of the spectrum of conversation one can have with a city.



. I had begun to build relationships with place-people. I started trying to understand grand overarching themes in the relationship and could not ignore the quaint details. Their relationship with money and currency -- do they raise an eyebrow when I pull out cash or not even bat an eyelid if I try to use Apple Pay? Understanding the commute -- how accepted is jaywalking, where are subway and bus stations, and what is the unspoken hierarchy of the streets? Picking up on the natural layouts of the city blocks -- how often can I expect a convenience store, and what can I expect to find there? What is the distribution of activities and eateries in the vicinity of eminent transit centers? Recognizing, respecting and understanding the ideals and values the place stands for -- be it the arts, marriage equality, traditionalist architecture, cosmetic surgery or embracing new technology. Learning their [language](languageliving.html) -- even if it may seem to use the same words and grammar as the language you spoke before, the local expressions, usage, intonations, insinuations of the words make it an entirely different language that requires attention and care to understand and use as one's own. The way the people navigate the city, their gut reactions to various everyday events, the [look in their eyes](eyes.html). I could write entire separate posts about each of those (as I already have for some of these), and so many more. This was the place communicating with me, sometimes through individuals, sometimes through the space.

Cities mold us as people more than other individuals. The things we overhear is the hivemind conversing with you about what it finds interesting. What we find in the stores is the place describing its lifestyle to you. What jobs the city offers and who the city celebrates whispers in our ears and influences our own ambitions. The looks you get when you do [your personal quirk](whatido.html) in public is how welcoming the city is towards you. When we're older, we have a set ambition we're working on, we have values we care about, many of these aspects of ours are already fairly well-defined. Then we're looking for a city that could be a better friend to us, or maybe even a family member.

Relationships with place-people are more similar to those with humans than we imagine. As you invest in building the relationship, the place-person treats you better, welcomes you, befriends you.

> Once you and a place-person become true friends, they have become a part of who you are, and you become a part of who they are.

This realization changed the way I interact with places greatly. It's important to me to try and befriend cities I like. And to know if I like them, I need to get to know them. As with people, the amount of time together is not as pivotal in getting to know each other as much as the quality of whatever time is spent together.


## Relationships
Most of us consider our human relationships inevitable and, as a result take them for granted. I believe we have a need for sharing context, experiences, thoughts and opinions to varying degrees of involvement and feedback. We desire consistency and reliability in at least some of our relationships. There are various models describing stage-wise progression of human relationships. Here's a simplified version I use

* Contact
* Involvement
* Intimacy
* Deterioration/Repair
* Stability/Conclusion

The stages are pretty self-explanatory. Each of these stages play out completely differently for each of our relationships. Sometimes Contact lasts months before moving into involvement. Sometimes we reach Intimacy within hours of Contact. Sometimes we skip straight to Conclusion. Sometimes Deterioration/Repair repeats several times, alternating, before arriving at Stability. My favorite stage to think about is Stability. To me this is defined by a state of mutual trust and expectations. We know what we can rely on each other for and 

During most of my life until this point I never consciously reflected on my relationships and their progressions. I think most of us don't think about this, we just "go with the flow." This is easy because there's so much explicit activity in a human relationship. Spoken conversation, shared activities and hobbies, eating meals together, common contexts like school and work. You can tell whether you're getting along or having fun from the flow of those activities.


















During my two-year nomad stint, roughly half the days were spent without speaking on any personal level to another human present in meatspace. In this time, while I wasn't distracted by individual humans, I began to treat the place I was in like the companion I was hanging out with. I imagined my city as a disembodied conglomerate being composed of the culture, history, food, language, architecture, weather, its causes and implications. They have a distinct personality, tastes, proclivities, opinions and flaws. They can be welcoming, diverse, stoic, rude, creative, hesitant, energetic. This is what I call the place-person.

Since I began thinking of the place-people model for cities, I always circle back to this.

No doubt, to a great extent the place-person is a manifestation of the hivemind of the people presently there. But in addition it represents those who built its history, as well as the friends of the place, past and present.

## Place-people Relationships

I found it was not that I was alone *in* a city -- I was alone *with* the city. Everything I did and felt while there was not just me, but between myself and the place. I had begun to build relationships with place-people. I started trying to understand grand overarching themes in the relationship and could not ignore the quaint details. Their relationship with money and currency -- do they raise an eyebrow when I pull out cash or not even bat an eyelid if I try to use Apple Pay? Understanding the commute -- how accepted is jaywalking, where are subway and bus stations, and what is the unspoken hierarchy of the streets? Picking up on the natural layouts of the city blocks -- how often can I expect a convenience store, and what can I expect to find there? What is the distribution of activities and eateries in the vicinity of eminent transit centers? Recognizing, respecting and understanding the ideals and values the place stands for -- be it the arts, marriage equality, traditionalist architecture, cosmetic surgery or embracing new technology. Learning their [language](languageliving.html) -- even if it may seem to use the same words and grammar as the language you spoke before, the local expressions, usage, intonations, insinuations of the words make it an entirely different language that requires attention and care to understand and use as one's own.

I could write entire separate posts about each of those (as I already have for some of these), and so many more. This was the place communicating with me, sometimes through individuals, sometimes through the space.

As I often do on this topic, this is a deeper exploration of a slice of Paul Graham's essay on [cities and ambition](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html).

Cities mold us as people more than other individuals. The things we overhear is the hivemind conversing with you about what it finds interesting. What we find in the stores is the place describing its lifestyle to you. What jobs the city offers and who the city celebrates whispers in our ears and influences our own ambitions.

As with people, the amount of time together is not as pivotal in getting to know each other as much as the quality of whatever time is spent together.

## Places as not-people

I am deeply uncomfortable by the way we talk about, think of, and treat places. They're treated as static, immutable entities without feelings or personalities. A dot on a map, a certain number of miles or hours away, a tick on "cost of living" and "income range" charts, the source of some specific kind of goods, aribitrarily the hub of some activity. They're all roughly the same, and seemingly the only explicit reasons we choose one over the country is its basic geographic relationship with our life -- distance from our job, our family, friends, and allowed legal presence where it applies. But real cities are so much more. 

> "I've seen Vietnam, I want to go to Cambodia next"

At best people treat places outside where they live like an average book or movie -- something that may have some depth, but once you've been through it you're done and never need go back to it, unless you feel like you "missed something" or want to "relive it". Is that how you treat the people you meet and get to know? Once you've had coffee with them once, you cross them off your list, occasionally mention to friends how you once had coffee with a person, remember nothing of their feelings or emotions in that conversation, and never think of them otherwise, except on some rare occasions where your experience was so magical you go out of your way to see them for another coffee? 

Okay fine that sounds like the dating life of millennials right now, and also some of the most impersonal human interactions our generation has ever had.

## My place-people

What a place means to someone is a function of the relationship. Just like between humans, no two people have the same relationship with a city. We tell stories of our lives, and often it was something that could never have happened anywhere but where it did. The city was in many ways a pivotal character in those stories, yet they are left out more often than not. And these stories span from transient events to the way it has influenced us over many years. They range from those we instantly got along with, some we just nodded our head to, those we're mildly annoyed and frustrated by, those we have complex relationships with, to those we actively avoid and dislike.

In September 2014, merely three days into my first visit to Hong Kong, the city broke out in one of the most profound protests in the world of our generation -- the [Umbrella Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests). The movement earned the name as the protesters stood steadfast in their cause withstanding bombardment of teargas from riot police using umbrellas. A simple yet powerful act -- they showed they wouldn't back down, but wouldn't resort to violence or misdemeanour. They did it in a way that was vibrantly visible to anyone looking. The city weeped, yet stood strong. The city fought, yet harmed noone. Unlike protests in other parts of the world, I didn't hesitate for a moment to take a walk through the protest grounds. The police worked with volunteers from the movement to keep bystanders safe. They handed out flyers along the periphery of the protests explaining both sides of the protest, meant for visitors, apologizing for inconveniencing their vacation. For three days Central Hong Kong remained blockaded. The nightlife was shut down, the top food tourist destinations were inaccessible. Half the subway lines were severed right at their fulcrum. But more than I felt inconvenienced in moving through the central parts of Hong Kong, I was touched that it shared this trying moment with me, a complete stranger. We got closer. I loved Hong Kong for the values it stood for and how it stood for them. I drop by for a visit every time I am able on my way elsewhere. And I will forever remember its struggle I was allowed to witness up close, to be a part of even barely.

Mere months earlier I was in Kochi in the south of India. It was perhaps the 25th time in my father's hometown in as many years of being alive, which by the arcane mechanics of cultural and societal heritage is supposedly mine as well. I have a strange relationship with Kochi. Having none but an Indian passport, being relatively fluent in the local language of Malayalam, and property in my family's name in the city doesn't make me feel close to Kochi. On the surface, Kochi pretends to care about the things that are important to me, but is way different underneath. It is constantly trying to be an innovation hub for the Indian peninsula, but constantly subpar in that respect. It wants to be technologically advanced, but entrenched lobbying and no genuine interest constantly prevents significant changes. I feel frustrated when I hang out with Kochi, like the friend who keeps claiming they're into the same things as you but really is only into pretending to care about those things, then flakes out on plans with you about those things. I have tried hard to build a functional relationship with Kochi, but we just can't see eye to eye on the things that matter to me, just by that tiny bit, that makes both of us have that annoying crick in the shoulder when spending time with each other. Just like you do when you have to hang out with your best friend's SO who you don't actually like that much but end up seeing a lot.

And oh, the Bay Area. I consider regions like the Bay like a house of 4-5 adults who live together, with some weird relationships and conflicts between each other, have independent lives, but still share a lot of things. San Francisco gets gentrified by Silicon Valley. People start to discover the East Bay. When people get "fuck you" rich from the Valley move to Marin and Los Gatos. People who don't live in SF city hate it but love to go in every weekend. People who live in SF city hate it when those people come and immediately start to complain about the homelessness and the resultant odors. I could write series of posts as involved as this one just about each part of the Bay I frequent. In fact, maybe I'll start doing that.

There are several places in between that I love dearly and keep going back to -- Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, London; several I am looking forward to getting to know -- Barcelona, Berlin, Shanghai; several I'm familiar with and not sure I can say I love as much -- Muscat, Dubai. I wish I could describe them all, but my wordsmithing would not do my relationship with them justice. If you were to spend time with those places, your relationships would be very different from mine. Ironically, beginning to understand my relationships with cities manifested as a deeper understanding of my human relationships. The reasons why I liked certain kinds of people, the effects they had on me were very similar to those of the cities I liked, and in many ways their personalities too. I also learned that you need to be conscious and put in effort to build a meaningful relationship with people, and that those things were linearly related. And the deeper your relationship, the more you are rewarded with their wisdom, insight, support and love.

So whether you're home, or on vacation, or on a business trip -- take a moment, speak to the place, listen to what it has to tell you. It's tempting to immediately judge its values by your own value system, just as we do with people. Fight that temptation. You may find an interesting friend. A friend different from the ones you have, who may teach you something new.

But most importantly, a friend who will remember you long, long after you're gone, and share your story as part of its own.

The first real vacation I took in years was in London, UK, January of 2017. I understood why I derived very limited contentment from doing the tourist circuit -- it was merely the facade the city put on for people who weren't actually interested in becoming friends. Like your party or office facade, sure it's relevant and still a part of you, and often people enjoy interacting with that and don't want to deal with your baggage. But that isn't who you fundamentally would be, if you had the choice. To me, doing no more than eating at the top-rated restaurants, taking selfies with the skyline and buying some souvenirs for friends back home felt a lot like going to a party and raiding the fridge of a host who invited you out of politeness.
