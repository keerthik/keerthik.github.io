During my two-year nomad stint, roughly half the days were spent without speaking on any personal level to another human present in meatspace. In this time, while I wasn't distracted by individual humans, I began to treat the place I was in like the companion I was hanging out with. I imagined my city as a disembodied conglomerate being composed of the culture, history, food, language, architecture, weather, its causes and implications. They have a distinct personality, tastes, proclivities, opinions and flaws. They can be welcoming, diverse, stoic, rude, creative, hesitant, energetic. This is what I call the place-person.

No doubt, to a great extent the place-person is a manifestation of the hivemind of the people presently there. But in addition it represents those who were there in the past, as well as the friends of the place, past and present.

## Place-people Relationships

I found it was not that I was alone *in* a city -- I was alone *with* them. Everything I did and felt while there was not just me, but between myself and the place. I had begun to build relationships with place-people. Handling their currency -- do they raise an eyebrow when I pull out cash, not even bat an eyelid if I try to use Apple Pay? Understanding their traffic expectations, which pertains to but is more than the laws -- how accepted is jaywalking, what is the unspoken hierarchy of the streets? Picking up on the natural layouts of the city blocks -- how often can I expect a convenience store, and what can I expect to find there? What is the distribution of activities and eateries in the vicinity of eminent transit centers? Recognizing, respecting and supporting the ideals and values the place stands for -- be it the arts, marriage equality, traditionalist architecture, cosmetic surgery or embracing new technology. Learning their [language](languageliving.html) -- even if it may seem to use the same words and grammar as the language you spoke before, the local expressions, usage, intonations, insinuations of the words make it an entirely different language that requires attention and care to understand and use as one's own. The way the people navigate the city, their gut reactions to various everyday events, the [look in their eyes](eyes.html). I could write entire separate posts about each of those (as I already have for some of these), and so many more. This was the place communicating with me, sometimes through individuals, sometimes through the space.

As I often do on this topic, this is an exploration of Paul Graham's essay on [cities and ambition](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html).

Cities mold us as people more than other individuals. The things we overhear is the hivemind conversing with you about what it finds interesting. What we find in the stores is the place describing its lifestyle to you. What jobs the city offers and who the city celebrates whispers in our ears and influences our own ambitions. The looks you get when you do [your personal quirk](whatido.html) in public is how welcoming the city is towards you. When we're older, we have a set ambition we're working on, we have values we care about, many of these aspects of ours are already fairly well-defined. Then we're looking for a city that could be a better friend to us, or maybe even a family member.

Relationships with place-people are more similar to those with humans than we imagine. As you invest in building the relationship, the place-person treats you better, welcomes you, befriends you.

> Once you and a place-person become true friends, they have become a part of who you are, and you become a part of who they are.

This realization changed the way I interact with places greatly. It's important to me to try and befriend cities I like. And to know if I like them, I need to get to know them. As with people, the amount of time together is not as pivotal in getting to know each other as much as the quality of whatever time is spent together.

## Places as not-people

I am deeply uncomfortable by the way we talk about, think of, and treat places. They're treated as static, immutable entities without feelings or personalities. A dot on a map, a certain number of miles or hours away, a tick on "cost of living" and "income range" charts, the source of some specific kind of goods, aribitrarily the hub of some activity. They're all roughly the same, and seemingly the only explicit reasons we choose one over the country is its basic geographic relationship with our life -- distance from our job, our family, friends, and allowed legal presence where it applies. But real cities are so much more.

At best people treat places outside where they live like an average book or movie -- something that may have some depth, but once you've been through it you're done and never need go back to it, unless it magically calls out to you. Is that how you treat the people you went out of your way to learn about and meet? Once you've had coffee with them once, you cross them off your list, occasionally mention to friends how you once had coffee with a person, remember nothing of the convresation, and never think of them otherwise? Okay that sounds like several of my dates, and the most impersonal relationships I've ever had.

## My place-people

What a place means to someone is a function of the relationship. Just like between humans, no two people have the same relationship with a city. We tell stories of our lives, and often it was something that could never have happened anywhere but where it did. The city was in many ways a pivotal character in those stories, yet they are left out more often than not. And these stories span from transient events to the way it has influenced us over many years. They range from those we instantly got along with, some we just nodded our head to, those we're mildly annoyed and frustrated by, those we have complex relationships with, to those we actively avoided and disliked. 

In September 2014, merely three days into my first visit to Hong Kong, the city broke out in one of the most profound protests of our generation -- the [Umbrella Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests). The movement earned the name as the protesters stood steadfast in their cause withstanding bombardment of teargas from riot police using umbrellas. A simple yet powerful act -- they showed they wouldn't back down, but wouldn't resort to violence or misdemeanour. They did it in a way that was vibrantly visible to anyone looking. The city weeped, yet stood strong. The city fought, yet harmed noone. Unlike protests in other parts of the world, I didn't hesitate for a moment to take a walk through the protest grounds. The police worked with volunteers from the movement to keep bystanders safe. They handed out flyers along the periphery of the protests explaining both sides of the protest, meant for visitors, apologizing for inconveniencing their vacation. For three days Central Hong Kong remained blockaded. The nightlife was shut down, the top food tourist destinations were inaccessible. Half the subway lines were severed right at their fulcrum. But more than I felt inconvenienced in moving through the central parts of Hong Kong, I was touched that it shared this trying moment with me, a complete stranger. We got closer. I loved Hong Kong for the values it stood for and how it stood for them. I drop by for a visit every time I am able on my way elsewhere. And I will forever remember its struggle I was allowed to witness up close, to be a part of even barely.

Mere months earlier I was in Kochi in the south of India. It was perhaps the 25th time in my father's hometown, which by the perverse mechanics of cultural and societal heritage is supposedly mine as well. I have a strange relationship with Kochi. Having none but an Indian passport, being relatively fluent in the local language of Malayalam, and property in my family's name in the city doesn't make me feel close to Kochi. On the surface, Kochi pretends to care about the things that are important to me, but is way different underneath. It is constantly trying to be an innovation hub for the Indian peninsula, but constantly subpar in that respect. It wants to be technologically advanced, but entrenched lobbying and no genuine interest constantly prevents significant changes. I feel frustrated when I hang out with Kochi, like the friend who keeps claiming they're into the same things as you but really is only into pretending to care about those things, then flakes out on plans with you about those things. I have tried hard to build a functional relationship with Kochi, but we just can't see eye to eye on the things that matter to me, just by that tiny bit, that makes both of us have that annoying crick in the shoulder when spending time with each other. Just like you do when you have to hang out with your best friend's SO who you don't actually like that much but end up hanging out with a lot.

And oh, the Bay Area. I could write series of posts as involved as this one just about each part of the Bay. I consider regions like the Bay like a house of 4-5 adults who live together, with some weird relationships and conflicts between each other, have independent lives, but still share a lot of things. San Francisco gets gentrified by Silicon Valley. People start to discover the East Bay. When people get "fuck you" rich from the Valley move to Marin and Los Gatos. People who don't live in SF city complain about it all the time but love to go in when cool things are going on.

Ironically, beginning to understand my relationships with cities manifested as a deeper understanding of my human relationships. The reasons why I liked certain kinds of people, the effects they had on me were very similar to those of the cities I liked, and in many ways their personalities too. I also learned that you need to be conscious and put in effort to build a meaningful relationship with people, and that those things were linearly related. And the deeper your relationship, the more you are rewarded with their wisdom, love, insight and 

So whether you're home, or on vacation, or on a business trip -- take a moment, speak to the place, hear what it has to tell you. You may find a lifelong friend. A friend vastly different from you, who will teach you something new. 

A friend who will remember you long, long after you're gone.

The first real vacation I took in years was in London, UK, January of 2017. I understood why I derived very limited contentment from doing the tourist circuit -- it was merely the facade the city put on for people who weren't actually interested in becoming friends. Like your party or office facade, sure it's relevant and still a part of you, and often people enjoy interacting with that and don't want to deal with your baggage. But that isn't who you fundamentally would be, if you had the choice. To me, doing no more than eating at the top-rated restaurants, taking selfies with the skyline and buying some souvenirs for friends back home felt a lot like going to a party and raiding the fridge of a host who invited you out of politeness.
