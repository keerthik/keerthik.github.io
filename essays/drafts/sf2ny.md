"Oh nice oh yeah this is our first time to Oakland. What about you, are you from around here?"
"Uhh," as my eyes subconsciously darted from side to side looking up and down MacArthur Blvd, "...I'm from Berkeley. Pretty much. Yeah. I'm turning over here, have fun out there!"
"Thanks for the directions, you too!" they said through a confused, amused twinkle in their eyes like they were looking at a little boy hiding a cookie behind his back and saying "I don't even like cookies."

I had decided giving directions while I'm also running late to my dinner plans was not the best time to engage in the philosophical debate of casually questioning my origin based on my brown skin, the legitimacy of my presence from my twinge of foreign accent, or to launch into my life story and why ["where are you from"](../fromwhere.html) is a loaded question for me.

In recent years, I have given a great deal of thought and care to the people and also [the cities I find myself surrounded by](../cities.html). It often happened in moments such as those immediately following the above encounter, as I power-walked past another homeless encampment under a highway in Oakland to a Korean tofu house.

## Coming to the Bay

I first bounced through the SF Bay Area when I was 10, in 1999, with my family. Our family was strictly lower middle class back then, and this was a vacation my parents had saved up for half a decade. So I don't remember much other than my parents saying $8 for a Boudin bread bowl was too expensive, as was $0.25 to use the binoculors off the wharf, as if binoculors would help pierce the thick fog that shrouded Alcatraz (where did that fog go in recent years, anyway?). And that "sunset" started at 6pm and only completed it's course by 9pm that summer. Basically my impression was "this place seems nice but too expensive for peasants like me". Ah, how prescient, 10-year-old me.

But I hardly associated the Bay with Silicon Valley, or tech, or smart, maniacal, idealistic visionaries from that visit. It was over 10 years later when I came back as part of Olin's SCOPE project with my team to spend 2 weeks at Autodesk's Idea Studio fellowship. My teammate Maia probably doesn't realize how much of an impact on my life she had by making this happen. My memory is hazy, but it went something like this...

Autodesk Liaison: We have a few folks who are excited about your project. I was thinking we could have your team be part of this program we run every year, called the Idea Studio, but we have never run it remotely before...

Me: Where is it normally?
Liaison: San Francisco
Maia: We're coming
Rest of the team: We are?
Maia: Yes (while looking up Idea Studio on her laptop). OMG you guys it's based right in downtown San Francisco. We *have* to go
Rest of us: I guess we are

Maia got us an Airbnb room in 2011 (before I knew this dingy little room rental company existed)
