Keerthik's Culture Guide

1) do you culturally belong to the classification yourself (ie, you're also white/asian/indian and want to date the same?)
2) did any of your last 3 (or as many as applicable) elongated romantic involvements deviate from the classification?
3) were you inextricably culturally immersed among those people (you lived in china and dated only chinese boys/girls)?

if you answer "no" to all of those you at high risk of X fever

answering 'yes' reduces your risk, from less to more, in order for questions 1 < 2 < 3

ie, answering 'yes' to (1) is the least likely to reduce your risk
