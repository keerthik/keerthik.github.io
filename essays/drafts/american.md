-- get treated without insurance as a visitor and fly back, is what I was going to say. Anyone who has heard more than a dozen words from me probably knows I'm not exactly gentle in expressing my fondness for America.

And yet, fondness is perhaps the expression that resonates with me the most, when it comes to this beautiful, proud and powerful, yet deeply flawed and insecure beast called America.

So for a change, I thought I'll pull out the soapbox to profess some love for the country I've decided to call home, and in a miraculous twist of fate has agreed to let me do so.
