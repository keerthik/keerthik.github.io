Less than Human

<div class="hidden-notes">
Things I can talk about
- Ambition, America, and the rest of the world
- Public discourse - "We talk about things"
- Being less than human to the system
- Races and relationships - the good, bad and the ugly
- Immigrating for a dream - being the most and least American at the same time
- The things I do/did to achieve humanhood (permanent residence/citizenship)

hi i was born/raised in different countries, none of them are home, but for my age i guess i've lived and gotten close to lots of different cultures, i have major identity crisis which is kinda popular for our generation, also immigration is a giant pile of shit, and americans have no idea how good they have it, esp with US immigration"

- Trajectory/story
- First taste of true cities - Boston, SF, having personality and traits, not just a place
- individuals
- The ideal learning environment for me -- absorption
- Dreams but no way to achieve them
- It's my Prison of Freedom
- I looked in the mirror and for the first time i saw the eyes of someone who felt like he could achieve whatever he pursued.
