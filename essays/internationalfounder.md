# International founders

<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko">on Medium</a></div>

This is the post-form of a talk I gave (will give) at my alma mater, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Reflects the situation between 2013 and 2016, that I am familiar with.

What happened to int'l?
2011 Ollie, Albert, 	Jay, me
2012 Ananya, 			Yifei, Varun, Rui, Trevor/Graham?
2013 Ais, Shane, Jason, Alison, Andrea, ?
2014 
2015 
2016 

## How do I want to organize the talk?
- sprinkle the life story?
- choose your own adventure?
- point + how it applies to each group? (keeps everyone involved on each point)
- touchy feely

## Points for international students
- Answer: Do you want to base out of the US?
- Why you'd want to base out of the US
- Reasons not to be based out of the US
- Research your options, pros and cons (IANAL)
-- Taking a year off
-- The foundry
-- Your OPT
- Research your limitations
- Cofounder vs Employment
- Explain, be ready to trust
- When it doesn't work out?

## Points for students who may want to work with internationals
- Recognize the challenges and limitations, and that you have a privilege
- Recognize the costs associated for them, you, your team
- Commit and follow-through, be trustworthy
- When it doesn't work out?

## Points for support network: Professors, College, etc
- 

Hi! I'm Keerthik <Omanakuttan>. Feel free to call me K. I'm an ECE class of 2011, one of the very first international students to be accepted to and graduate from Olin.

I am the cofounder of BitGym, an interactive fitness software company based out of Berkeley.

BitGym is a mostly-bootstrapped, currently ramen-profitable 4-person software company. I'm the only non-US founder and employee. You'll learn more about me, my work, and BitGym over the course of our discussion. You may have a number of questions about that stuff. Unless it's super-directly pertinent to the whole international student situation at hand, I'd be happy to answer those after the talk/workshop.
