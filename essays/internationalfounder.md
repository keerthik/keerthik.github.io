# International founders

<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko">on Medium</a></div>

This is the post-form of a talk I gave (will give) at my Alma Mater, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Reflects the situation between 2013 and 2016, that I am familiar with.

What happened to int'l?
2011 Ollie, Albert, 	Jay, me
2012 Ananya, 			Yifei, Varun, Rui, Trevor/Graham?
2013 Ais, Shane, Jason, Alison, Andrea, ?
2014 
2015 
2016 
## How do I want to organize the talk?
- sprinkle the life story?
- point + how it applies to each group? (keeps everyone involved on each point)

## Points for international students
- Answer: Do you want to base out of the US?
- Why you'd want to base out of the US
- Reasons not to be based out of the US
- Research your options, pros and cons (IANAL)
- Cofounder vs Employment
- Explain, be ready to trust
- When it doesn't work out?

## Points for students who may want to work with internationals
- Recognize the challenges, your privilege
- Recognize the costs associated for them, you, your team
- Commit and follow-through, be trustworthy
- When it doesn't work out

## Points for support network: Professors, College, etc
