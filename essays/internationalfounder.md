# International founders

<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko">on Medium</a></div>

This is the post-form of a workshop/presentation I gave (will give) at my alma mater, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Reflects the situation between 2013 and 2016, that I am familiar with.

What happened to int'l?
2011 Ollie, Albert, Jay, me
2012 Ananya, Yifei, Varun, Rui, Trevor, Graham?
2013 Ais, Shane, Jason, Alison, Andrea, ?
2014 
2015 
2016 

## How do I want to organize the talk?
- sprinkle the life story?
- choose your own adventure?
- point + how it applies to each group? (keeps everyone involved on each point)
- touchy feely

## Points of interest
- DISCLAIMER
- Internships
- Taking a semester/year off (dark side -- dropping out)
- "Trying stuff out"
- "Move first, figure out work later"
- If you want to start a company, your OPT might be your best shot

## Points for international students
- Cofounder vs Employment
- Answer: Do you want to base out of the US?
- Why you'd want to base out of the US
- Reasons not to be based out of the US
- Research your options, pros and cons (IANAL)
-- Taking a year off
-- The foundry
-- Your OPT
- Network
- Come to Silicon Valley
- Explain, be ready to trust
- When it doesn't work out?

## Points for students who may want to work with internationals
- Recognize what they bring
- Recognize the challenges and limitations, and that you have a privilege
- Recognize the costs associated for them, you, your team
- Commit and follow-through, be trustworthy
- When it doesn't work out?

## Points for support network: Professors, College, etc
- the side that encounters the problems don't know the solutions, the side with the solutions doesn't realize the problems
- College: Many of the resources sideline international students
-- NASA, defense contractors, several internship providers are reluctant
-- Olin will work with international students to recognize these, bridge the gap
- You may not be able to help. It may sound like whining. 

## Intro
(feel free to skip this section)

Hi! I'm Keerthik <Omanakuttan>. Feel free to call me K. I'm an ECE class of 2011, one of the very first international, non-resident students to be accepted to and graduate from Olin.

<<DISCLAIMER: IANAL. Please verify official relevant USCIS documentation and/or seek licensed legal counsel before acting on any advice here>>

Before I go any further, I have to put this up here. I am not a lawyer, and none of what I say here is to be construed as legal counsel. Some of it may have changed since I last researched it, or since this presentation, or may just be plain incorrect because I'm stupid. Some will be different based on your personal circumstances like nationality, etc. So please double-check with official information from a licensed immigration lawyer, up-to-date USCIS documentation before acting on any advice I give here. This is so important I'm going to leave this at the bottom of every slide hereafter.

That said, I've put in countless hours since 2008 researching and working through different aspects of immigration, and more importantly, side effects of dealing with it. Many of you may have independently had to redo a lot of that work. I am going to prioritize all the things I wished someone told me to spend time on as a student because of my immigration status. As one of the lowest common denominators in the international student as an Indian passport holder, I will speak from that perspective. It's unlikely your immigration situation will be more restrictive than mine was.

# About me
I am the cofounder of BitGym, an interactive fitness software company based out of Berkeley. Our team is only 5 full time members, including Josh McCready '10. BitGym is a mostly-bootstrapped, currently ramen-profitable 5-person software company. I'm the only non-US-citizen founder, holding an Indian passport. You'll learn more about me, my work, and BitGym over the course of our discussion. You may have a number of questions about that, and other stuff I may bring up. Unless it's super-directly pertinent to the whole international student situation at hand, I'd be happy to answer those afterwards. Any directly relevant questions or thoughts however, raise your hand and we can tackle it rightaway.

# Founder vs Employee
This is something very important to learn about yourself as an international student. When I was a student, I didn't think I'd want to be a company founder.

# The N-word 
We should be raised to despise it, and never use it among polite company. Networking. This is a whole other topic that is important for your career in many ways, but its power in immigration is irreplaceable. Fundamentally, we are in a position with frustratingly little power as immigrants. The American promise of "you can do whatever you want, be whatever you want" explicitly does not apply to us.

# Where you are matters - Come to Silicon Valley
Most famously, the kinds of talent you can pick up, and investment lies in Silicon Valley. Less well-known, and probably more important, the demographics of people willing to try out your product and talk about it more are also there.

## Dump
Advice in life story form
When I was a student, I didn't think I'd want to be a company founder. I always thought I'd known what I'd want to do with my life -- make computer games. Growing up with middle class educated Indian parents, they deftly guided me down a path towards computer programming and engineering, the path du jour of a cushy office job. Ideal for predictably eventually buying a house and having babies and stuff.

This is a question for you to answer, but it's very important, and give it serious consideration. The fact that you've shown up here means you have at least entertained the thought in the back of your mind. That's already more than I did, and here I am now.

I highly recommend working at the closest thing you can find to the kind of "employment" you are considering for an internship. If you want to work in a big 5 software firm, give serious consideration to a Google/MS/IBM/Apple role. No matter what you feel like posting on social media about it, brutally honestly extrapolate that experience 5 years and think about how you'd feel about that. Keep in mind to be realistic, the grass is always greener on the other side, etc.

Why I ask this. For the more typical Olin grad, I would recommend working at a BigCo first, put a 1.5~2 year re-evaluation deadline, maybe work as an early employee for a startup, and then found a company after having learned a lot, figuring out what works best for your style and skills.

For international graduates, I'd say this is backwards, and this is greatly a function of the current immigration environment. Ironically, the best opportunity you will have to start a company is right after you graduate. The OPT is the most flexible work authorization afforded international students. You can work for a big company, you can be a freelancer, start your own company, or most things in between. So if when you look out at industry right now and can't find or land the dream job, but you have a fair idea what it would entail, consider starting it up.



Alumni:
I am (tentatively most likely) doing a talk/presentation at Olin on being an international-student-turned-founder. A big part of this is understanding what non-internationals
