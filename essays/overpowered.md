# Overpowered

When creating a game with a sizeable variety of mechanics that are meant to work in tandem with each other, there are a number of apparent challenges, like balance and learning curve. There are also a few less apparent challenges; one that we discovered is that it's difficult to test what works and what doesn't as not everything gets played in every game. 

The main strength of having a mix of diverse mechanics is in fun factor, at the cost of the challenges mentioned above -- every game is more interesting, epic and creative because of the increased surface area for interaction between mechanics. Hence, it is paramount that every mechanic is satisfying and fun to play, before they need to be balanced, simplified, or printed on a rule card. And the best way to work on that aspect is to repeatedly see how players react to a mechanic coming into play, the caster and opponent both, over a number of games and cicrumstances. If the right reactions come out, every challenge involved is worth it, and that's always the most important thing for us game designers. And to observe those reactions, we need the playtesters to play our newest mechanics, the ones we are most unsure about.

One approach to encourage playtesters to bring out those mechanics is something we see classically in "Games as a service" video games like League of Legends or Hearthstone: Overpower the mechanics you want to observe for a period of time. "Overpowering" refers to raising the numbers on new spells, champions, or cards to just above your intuition for balance. And then rebalancing the skill when you're satisfied with other factors of the mechanic before solidifying the mechanics' place in the game.

The first and simplest thing to see is how excited players are to bring out the mechanics. That indicates how fun it is for the primary stakeholder, the mechanic owner player. If despite being overpowered it is not favoured over the familiar mechanics of the game, then there is something fundamental lacking about the new spell, unit, or property you introduced to the game. The next stakeholders are opponents. Certainly, opposition players will exhibit frustration facing such new (overpowered) mechanics. But what needs attention is the primary root cause of those frustrations. Is it [fun to face](antifun.html)? Is it because the effects are unintuitive? Is it because the counter that you as the designer had in mind (or another) hasn't been figured out yet, but players are trying? Are players just bored and uninterested in figuring it out, and just find ways to circumvent or avoid it? Once those been cleared, and player frustrations can be traced to the fact that the numbers just don't play out, then it is finally time to rebalance the mechanic in context with the rest of the game.

There are a few things to watch out for. For one, you certainly have to Overpower in moderation. In widely played games like DOTA or LoL, there is persistant bitterness in forums about new heroes being overpowered and players vowing to quit the game forever (they never do) due to how frustrating it is playing against them. It takes a certain amount of strength to keep improving your game in the face of that, but at the same time it gives you vastly more data to work with than doing in-house alpha tests. In our case with Dicestorm, Occasionally odue to the difficulty of organizing tests, I try to test too many previously-untested mechanics at once. Other times I've caught myself rebalancing other aspects of the game when they were perfectly fine to work with my new overpowered mechanic, throwing off balance game-wide. Sometimes we legitimately over-overpower units, making the entire game unfun. 

Playtests are extremely valuable and potent in making a game amazing, whether a video game or board game, and using the principle of per-playtest overpowering, you can covertly encourage use of an isolated mechanic to gather the data you want to see how players physically and emotionally react to having it come into play.
