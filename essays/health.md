## Personal health

Since 2012, building [BitGym](https://www.bitgym.com?ref=korc) has been my full time job and I have spent a lot of time researching health and fitness products, services and, more generally, advice. What I've noticed is that a lot of what we're told about tends to be unsubstantiated pseudo-science as often as not, with lots of contradictory advice and weak explanations.

I think everyone knows "quality food, exercise and sleep is good for you", but noone knows what that is for everyone. It varies from person to person, circumstance to circumstance, and the effects (good or bad) are hard to observe and correlate to choices, so it's hard to justify or blame them accurately. Especially when the accepted "facts" keep flip-flopping every 5-10 years (fats are bad! fats are good! sugar is bad! sugar is good! phasic sleep is good! no, you should sleep 8 hours in one go! you should always sleep in the middle of the night! no, it's possible daytime sleep is better for you!) At some point, it feels like if you just make random lifestyle choices, even a broken clock will be right twice a day?

Nutrition and sleep science are both still very loosey-goosey and the surprising thing to me is that we don't invest in significantly more in-depth research to find better metrics and measurements and baseline principles to teach kids.

The only thing I can say with any confidence is that every individual's physiology is at least slightly different, even if our fundamental biology is mostly the same. There are also a lot of mental and emotional aspects connecting sleep, diet, exercise, and health (how fun they are, who you get to do them with, how people around you make you feel about doing what you do). 

The best health practice you can develop is learning to listen to your body and its needs, and keeping track of how you feel over time, and making adjustments as needed.
