Where Are You From?

This question is a popular modern gripe among especially Asian Americans, but really a descendent of an immigrant of pretty much ethnicity, in almost any country.

I understand some of the motivations behind that question -- a succinct question and answer to create a rough model of who I am based on their knowledge of the world. What language(s) does he know? What are his core moral values? What kind of culture is he familiar with? Is he religious? What food might he like? What did he probably study or work on? What are some of his favorite pastimes? And beyond all that, what ethnicity is he? That last question could be anything from idle curiosity to subconscious racist inclinations, and this is the aspect that mostly bothers people.

To me the concept of associating a person's origin with a geographic region is becoming an outdated one. Why, you may ask. The same reason Blockbuster is outdated -- the internet in particular, media in general. The world is a lot smaller than it used to be and cultural boundaries are very blurred. There are so many external factors influencing a person's growth that the geographic indicator is very weak. Even parents' cultural values are transferred a lot less prominently than they used to be. From a super young age, everyone's surface area of exposure to outside perspectives -- outside of their town/state/country mind you -- is SO much larger than it used to be before the internet.

I grew up (0-18) in Muscat, capital of the quaint Middle Eastern country Oman. I visited my parents' hometowns in Kerala, southern tip of India for approximately 3 weeks every year. I studied in Boston (18-22), and moved to the Bay to start working for BitGym (22-24). I was then a digital nomad for nearly 2 years (24-26) residing in 9 different Asian countries before returning to the Bay. But no matter what single-location answer I give to this question, the asker's model will be grossly inaccurate, not even taking into account that they probably hold a warped view of the culture and people from most of those places anyway. I'm always the one to veto the Indian restaurant. I can speak less than 10 words of Arabic after 18 of my spongiest years in Oman. On the other hand, I can hold conversation with native Japanese speakers where I spent less than 3 months of my life. Mostly because that was not where I learned the language -- I watch more than twice as much anime as I do Hollywood, Bollywood, western television and cricket combined.

If I had to say where I'm from, the most accurate answer after "my mom" would probably be "the internet".

- not about associating my physical features with a geography
- I am from a generation where there exist people who are not "from" anywhere
- recognize what you actually want to know and ask questions that would answer that

This is apparently less a problem if you're white. My gut reaction to that realization was "that's some white privilege right there" because white people usually never get to identify with a culture that's not predominantly white anyway. But hey, we all hear you if you're white and trying to say "I'm from Fukuoka" or something, noone believes you, but instead ask you "where you're really from?"
