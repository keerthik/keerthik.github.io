Where Are You From?

This question is probably a popular gripe in your circles if you're Asian American. Or a descendent of an immigrant of pretty much ethnicity in almost any country.

This is apparently less a problem if you're white. My gut reaction to that realization was "that's some white privilege right there" because white people usually never get to identify with a culture that's not predominantly white anyway. But hey, we all hear you if you're white and trying to say "I'm from Tokyo" and noone believes you but keep asking you "where you're really from?"

That said, my beef with the question, while related, is focused a little differently. I actually straight up don't have a feasible answer to that question. I understand some of the motivations behind that question -- a succinct question and answer to create a rough model of who I am based on their knowledge of the world. What language(s) does he know? What are his core moral values? What kind of culture is he familiar with? Is he religious? What food might he like? What did he probably study or work on? What are some of his favorite pastimes? And even though this is completely irrelevant for anything on it's own once I have the above answers, what ethnicity is he?

To me the concept of associating a person's origin with a geographic region is an outdated one. Why? The same reason Blockbuster is outdated -- the internet in particular, media in general. The world is a lot smaller than it used to be and cultural boundaries are very blurred. There are so many external factors influencing a person's growth that the geographic indicator is very weak. Even parents' cultural values are transferred a lot less prominently than they used to be. From a super young age, everyone's surface area of exposure to outside perspectives -- outside of their town/state/country mind you -- is SO much larger than it used to be before the internet.

Since I clearly started writing this article so I could talk about myself, let's take my case for instance. I grew up (0-18) in Muscat, capital of the quaint Middle Eastern country Oman. I visited my parents' hometowns in Kerala, southern tip of India for approximately 3 weeks every year. I studied in Boston (18-22), and moved to the Bay to start working for BitGym (22-24). I was then a digital nomad for nearly 2 years (22-26) residing in 9 different Asian countries before returning to the Bay. But no matter what single-location answer I give to this question, the asker's model will be grossly inaccurate, not even taking into account that they probably hold a warped view of the culture and people from most of those places anyway. I'm always the one to veto the Indian restaurant. I watch more than twice as much anime as Hollywood, Bollywood, western TV and cricket combined. 

If I had to say where I am, the most accurate answer after "my mom" would probably be "the internet".

- not about associating my physical features with a geography
- I am from a generation where there exist people who are not "from" anywhere
- recognize what you actually want to know and ask questions that would answer that
