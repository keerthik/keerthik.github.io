# Get Cooking
<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko/toys-to-games-25d35b40425d">on Medium</a></div>

cooking is about figuring out how you can obtain food you can eat with the ability to tune for as many parameters as possible, including convenience, cost, health, quantity, time commitment, sex appeal.
- knowing what's poison
This is the most important part. There's no point if you can't tell if your food will make people fall sick. You need to remember to check expiry dates. Be able to tell when ingredients have gone bad. You need to know if you made something inedible via overcooking, dropping it on the floor, leaving it out too long or letting vermin get to it. Be aware of how something can be changed from poisonous to edible and vice versa. For example, you can't just cut the moldy bit of bread away and then eat the rest -- the actual mold permeates the entire bread, and the green stuff are just spores.

- knowing about proportions
Once you can make sure you won't die from your food, you need to know how to put them together to get what you want. How much water goes in the rice cooker, how much oil you need to simmer, stir-fry, deep fry. How much seasoning, how much of different base ingredients go together. Then there's proportions of how much of different components of the meal to put together to serve one. How much of carbs, how much meat, how much veges.
- knowing about fire, heat and timing
- knowing your way about a kitchen -- where things are kept, what different things do
- knowing how to clean things in the kitchen
- knowing how to handle your foods -- cutting, cracking, peeling, pouring, sprinkling
- knowing about portions, sizes and appetites
