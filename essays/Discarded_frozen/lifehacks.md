## Tech
Add yourself as a contact on gchat -- use another account if you have one, or create one. This is useful for messaging stuff between your phone and computer in a very streamlined way.

Carry around an old candy-bar phone as an emergency phone. These normally use full-size SIMs, but you can just carefully place a micro/nano SIM over the contacts and stuff paper around it to keep it from moving.

## Travel

Book travel in the middle of the week. Book flight dates that are in the middle of the week too. Book approximately 3 months ahead of your first leg. If you're on a multicity vacation, try adding an extra major metropolitan city that's along the route, it might reduce prices drastically.
