## History lesson
eSports has been on a meteoric rise for the last decade. 

## Sports and Gender
- Traditional sports segregated. eSports may open the way to stopping that being the default.

## 5-minute sport design exercise
Anything can be an exciting sport because of "metagame." That doesn't make it a good "game."

First, it's going to be a team game. Let's make it 6 a side, just because. "Yeah teamwork!"
Then, it's going to be symmetric. Both sides have the same goals to attain and defend with the same team size. "Woah it's balanced!"
Let's play it on a hexagonal patch of land. "Mastery means learning things, such as the precise dimensions of the playing field."
Let's use a ball for this sport. What should players do with this ball? How about, they need to get it to a specific side of the court?
Now add some constraints. You have to get it to the directly opposite side. 

- The point is that it's easy to make something exciting enough to spectate.
- Spectating is more about the energy of the crowd and enthusiasm of the people who actually know/care about what's going on.

## What is on the horizon
Physical sports competing with eSports for viewership. Sports have to be more exciting than the metagame.

LoL trying to be a lifestyle game that lasts through the generations. They currently do this by *not* being a static game, but they could reduce the pace of game evolution down to just maintenance and cosmetics.

We're in the era of the intellectual. Geeks are sexy, glasses are in style, and the last thing we want to be identified is as a musclehead.

There is little room for the observant, quick-thinking, 

- Make physical sports turn from relics we have to work with, to games vying to be more fun and more challenging.
