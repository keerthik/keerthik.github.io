Working on bitgym has been cool for many reasons
- i love being surprised, having things turn out exactly NOT how I foresaw it
- the missions addresses a real problem affecting real people in the whole world
- old people, new kind of software. They love it. Kind of awesome.

It's an interesting exercise in entrepreneurship
In Silicon Valley there are a couple of mantras repeated constantly. 
"Move fast, break things"
"Talk to your users"
"Do things that don't scale"
"Make something a few users really love, rather than something a lot of people kinda like"
"Don't grow (the team size) too fast or too early"
"Care about the problem, not your solution"
"Success is sometimes just about not quitting"

Well, we're certainly sticking out a couple of these. However, at some point we have to call our sacrifices and move on.
