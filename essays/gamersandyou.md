# Gamers and You

<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko">on Medium</a></div>

If you're reading this, it's highly likely you are very close to at least one gamer. Probably several. Or of course you are one of us.

This is an extremely important topic to me, so bear with me as I try to be thorough. Let's talk about what it is to be a Gamer. 

## Meet The Gamer
There's a difference between a Gamer and someone who plays games, and that's one of identity. This difference is NOT a question of *how much* they play games, or about *what genre of games*. It's not just a pastime or a passing hobby, but something that's part of who they are. If and when it goes away or it's taken away from them, they become a significantly different person. Think about that Runner or Bookworm friend you have -- they may do "it" all the time, or just whenever they can. They feel good about the time, effort and money they spend on it, and never regret it. They love to talk about it. For the most part, they appreciate being known by that identity. And if they are deprived of it against their desire, say because they're traveling or injured, they get anxious and irritable. There exist other people who enjoy the same activities, and even spend more time doing them, but they may not identify with it. That difference in relationship with the activity is the difference between the Runner and the person who runs regularly. The Bookworm, the Programmer, the Party-thrower, are other examples of this category of personas.

But it can change, one's identity is never static. It could happen for great reasons -- finding something else they love to spend their time on even more like becoming a parent or starting a new lifelong project. And just as well for unfortunate reasons -- becoming handicapped, unable to afford the hobby, or banned from it by a partner or family for so long they can never return.

Obviously, being a Gamer doesn't preclude me also strongly identifying as an Entrepreneur, or Anime-nerd, or whatever. Gamer is a part of who I am, but not all of it.

Great that's out of the way.

## Are We Misunderstood?
I wish I could say "no longer," but while it's way less misunderstood than 20 years ago, it still has a ways to go.
Gaming is a new thing.

-- friendships and distance - frozen without activities
-- technology and activities - variety of collaborative distance activities
-- esports and friendships
-- those around gamers -- LoL/SC2 matches


Usually my writing targets core gamers interested in discussing a nuanced facet of game impact or design. This post, however, is probably more for those who do not identify as gamers, but have one in their lives -- whether a sibling, significant other, child or friend.

gamers and non-gamers, how games affect their lives.
the next generation - online games will be like playing a regular sport today. Would you stop your significant other in the middle of a tennis game, even if it was a casual pickup game, in order to go out to dinner, even though waiting for his game to end would mean you'd be 10 minutes late? In fact, the closer and more intense the game is, the less likely you are to force them to stop.

The last quarter-decade has seen as much technological advancement as the hundred or so years prior.  in the way distances, frequency and activities over which people interact than any other period in history.
