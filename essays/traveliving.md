? Life story? 

## Internal Change
People change. After about the age of 20, we all know logically that we have changed a lot and will continue to do so, yet we don't internalize this. We project the future based on maintaining the same tastes, preferences, values and ambitions as we have today. 

Why do we change? We change when things get hard. Things get hard when we might make mistakes. We make mistakes when we are in unfamiliar circumstances.

Over these past 2 years, I have constantly been in unfamiliar circumstances. I was constantly exposing myself to potentially making mistakes. And I changed a lot as a result. I became a completely different person from who I used to know, and I had to get reacquainted with myself every so often. 

Luckily, that wasn't so hard because I got to spend a lot of time with me.

## Loneliness


## Work
- Remote member of non-remote team > 2 people is difficult. You miss a lot of low-amplitude signals as they are deemed noise. 
- There's a lot of duplication of work for the colocated people to keep you in the loop.

### Willpower is limited
- Routine is hard when everything changes every 15-30 days
- Productivity (Motivation/Willpower + Discipline) is hard while remote/alone
- Dependence on your distractions

## Social
- Overhearing
- I have made a lot of friends, but I have made few friendships
- Asia is risk-averse
- You become more and more like those around you
- I am not afraid like I used to be
- I know what I like to do when I'm by myself, which is who I am independent of others.
- "Two sides to every coin"

## Picking a country
- A predictable environment is stress-free. You don't want to be constantly worrying about your internet, power or water, whether transit will be operational, whether you will be over charged for something. 
- first-world benefits allow us to do better work (mosquitoes, heat, stability, etc)

## Picking a Home
- Stay near transit
- Shared rooms are cheap. But watch out for snorers.
- AirBnB is the easiest to search, pick and book stress-free.

## What will I miss?
Whenever I find myself complaining a lot about a certain situation, I make it a habit to keep track of things I will miss
- Choosing my weather
- Good, cheap food all around me
- Having no things. It reduces stress ridiculously (offset by other things stressing me out way more though)
- Time with "nothing else to do". A lot of my personal development happened because I would be minorly burned out from working or just plain unable to work (no internet, standing in a bus, etc). Long continuous such periods gave me a lot of time to introspect, reflect, meditate, explore and understand myself that I would never have done (and probably never will) without such constraining circumstances.
- Amazing internet in many of the cities I loved (Seoul/Tokyo/Osaka)
- Shallow relationships - so much less social pressure
- Being honest because I don't care about being judged
- Being able to sing at the top of my lungs while I code from my isolated suburban home
