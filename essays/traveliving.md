# Working out of AirBnBs for over a year
<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/@keerthiko">on Medium</a></div>

*In December 2013, I left San Francisco to begin my life as a digital nomad, mostly in Asia, while I continue to work remotely for my startup, [BitGym](www.bitgym.com).*

## Work
- Remote member of non-remote team > 2 people is difficult. You miss a lot of low-amplitude signals as they are deemed noise. 
- There's a lot of duplication of work for the colocated people to keep you in the loop.

### Willpower is limited
- Routine is hard when everything changes every 15-30 days
- Productivity (Motivation/Willpower + Discipline) is hard while remote/alone
- Dependence on your distractions

## Social
- Overhearing
- I have made a lot of friends, but I have made few friendships
- Asia is risk-averse
- You become more and more like those around you
- I am not afraid like I used to be
- I know what I like to do when I'm by myself, which is who I am independent of others.
- "Two sides to every coin"

## Picking a country
- A predictable environment is stress-free. You don't want to be constantly worrying about your internet, power or water, whether transit will be operational, whether you will be over charged for something. 
- first-world benefits allow us to do better work (mosquitoes, heat, stability, etc)

## Picking a Home
- Stay near transit
- Shared rooms are cheap. But watch out for snorers.
- AirBnB is the easiest to search, pick and book stress-free. www.airbnb.com/c/komanakuttan

## What will I miss?
Whenever I find myself complaining a lot about a certain situation, I make it a habit to keep track of things I will miss
- Being able to sing at the top of my lungs while I code from my isolated suburban home
- Good, cheap food all around me
- Having no things. It reduces stress ridiculously (offset by other things stressing me out way more though)
- Time with "nothing else to do". A lot of my personal development happened because I would be minorly burned out from working or just plain unable to work (no internet, standing in a bus, etc). Long continuous such periods gave me a lot of time to introspect, reflect, meditate, explore and understand myself that I would never have done (and probably never will) without such constraining circumstances.
