# Working at Early-stage

In the STEM field, a fairly common question near-grads try to answer

> Should I work at the small startup/start my own company, or join a big corporation?

Countless blog/forum/quora posts exist addressing this question, and every student's circumstances are different enough meaning no matter how many of these you read, the decision remains unclear.

Since I chose the former, I'll talk about some characteristics of life given that choice, that I haven't seen discussed much elsewhere. And to be clear, it'll be in the context of a specific startup scenario - pre-funding, early stage, self-sustaining, small-team.

## Poor
We try not to talk about not hitting payroll, but it sure happens. Often, it is the decision of the entire team to forego the paycheck, burning our personal runways. There is a non-monetary cost with every month of not receiving a paycheck, but it also gives us clear deadlines. Turns out, it's actually not that hard to live on very little income, as a single, new grad with the insurance of the hireability of a software engineer. we're not damned to poverty, we're just...resourceful.

## Resourcefulness
You are either naturally resourceful, or learn to be resourceful, or tire of trying to be and quit. It's kind of an exciting game, trying to maximize utility with what you have. You will spend some months with a sub-poverty-line pay, and you'll get creative to make do. You may sublet when you leave town, trim some expeditures from your life, cook more, bike and run to get around. I wound up mastering a bunch of new life skills while learning to live on a tighter budget.

## Health
As a direct result of the above, you lead a much healthier lifestyle than the vast majority of your former classmates. All that biking, walking and running while they're in their fancy cars or on that company-paid commuter ride. The home-cooked, less fatty/oily food because you sure can't be expected to spend $25+/day on meals. The complete absence of snacks because that shit is expensive. The controlled meal sizes because you only eat what you need, not polishing off a cafeteria buffet. Hitting the bar is not even a question.

These things pay off quite easily and quickly when they're your daily routine. The motivation required to consistently make the healthier decision is a lot more easily found when that's the only good choice in the short-term AND the long-term.


## You have more time, not less
This is one of the least expected, and in my opinion most valuable benefits of my career choice - I have more time to pursue projects and activities outside of work. There are three main aspects that make this happen. 

### Flexibility
I don't need to come into work if I don't think I will be effective for the day, as long as I hit the goals expected of me. This means if 9-5 is more productive for me doing chores or working on my personal projects, I can work on the product over the weekend when I don't want to go out, or late at night, or during the moment of inspiration, or while waiting for the subway, or whenever I feel like it. Not having to waste 8 hours of my day hoping to be productive eventually has created so much more time in my day.

### Control
Sure, I may spend a few nights a week coming home really late. But generally, as part of a tiny team, I can exercise some control in scoping and scheduling product goals that I have to work on. As long as I learn to estimate well and exercise my involvement in the company, I'm not pulling allnighters left and right. Of course, I don't estimate very well every time, but that's my fault, not my job's.

### Mental Drain
During the day I may think really hard and long brainstorming ideas, designing software architecture, stressing about a live-in-production bug or arguing about a product decision. But the work is stimulating and fun, not mind-numbing and rote. Unlike the rest of my body, my brain feels a lot less tired the more fresh work it's given. Almost every day, I'm excited to get home after a grueling day of coding at work, just to fire up my home computer and code a different project, write a thoughtful post, have a call with my teammates on other projects or learn about a new technology. Dinner and bedtime are afterthoughts, unless I have plans (I don't). I can live my life pretty much exactly how I would like to, every single day, and feel great about it. 

The three months during college when I interned at BigCorpCo., this was as far from true as possible. I worked strictly 9-5, 5 days a week, on mediocre problems. And wanted to do absolutely nothing between 5 and 11 besides cook/eat dinner, read Wikipedia and play games. In the weekends I just wanted to meet up with friends and go have fun somewhere, blowing the bank I amassed having while my soul sucked during the week. I shudder at the thought of living every week like that.

## Fib
This is fairly well-known within the startup bubble - startup founders and early hires feel the need to put up a front. "Things are really looking up," we say, while we haven't hit payroll for the last 3 months. For the first year or so, you fib to friends and family about funding being just about the corner. A huge partnership with a major player that is about to materialize will change the everything. A big client is seriously interested. They may all be true, but note the "almost" nature of all these things. 

People who hear this a lot know what's going on. If you hear this kind of thing from your potential employer, you're probably going to be saying this too if you take the job.

We do it partly so our friends and family don't worry about us, but moreso to convince ourselves that we're still on track. We want to believe what we're saying, and sometimes we repeat the same fib to so many people that we really do end up believing it ourselves.

It's a lot easier to just say things are going great, rather than try to explain that "they may or may not be and I don't really know". I am personally trying to be more honest about this.

## Envy
I don't really know if this is a result of excellent fibbing over a long time, the grass being greener on the other side or them genuinely being miserable. But 9 times out of 10, after a conversation about work my friends are jealous as heck of my circumstances. My career is certainly riddled with its troubles, but I have a hard time rebuffing their envy. It starts to feel awkward because even I don't think my startup life is that great (yet). I think this is mostly because I don't quite understand the details of what's good and bad about their work-life, I just know it's definitely not for me.

I think it can be attributed in part to the way I try to spin everything positively even if they're actually shitty things, as you can tell from parts of this post. Because so many things are unstable and uncertain, I try to find things to be happy about. And with that startup blood, I try to pitch everything such that you would want it too.

## Relationships
This is one of the most stressful and scary aspects of building a startup -- your relationships are all ticking time bombs. Your relationship with your parents, close friends, housemates, teammates and definitely any potential romantic interests, not one is spared. 

You keep fibbing as mentioned to duct-tape over any cracks in these relationships. But eventually people catch on and many of them can't take it any more, feeling like their being led on.   
With our heads filled with business thoughts morning to night, we miss details in our loved ones' lives. Often, our startup or how we're coping with your "hardships" is all I'll ever talk about.

Low expenditure is fine when we're only responsible for ourselves, but it greatly limits our social flexibility. Your non-existent savings make you terrible mate material, meaning you're looking at a delayed life-partnership. Any significant other you may have when this started is probably tiring of the whole thing and just wants out as you're wasting their time.   Depending on your cultural background, this could also mean your parents could start breathing down your neck about dropping the whole thing.  

We stop being able to hang out with your friends at bars and theaters and concerts and fancy restaurants, and they get tired of adjusting to our "creative and affordable" ideas.

As you clear the 22-27 age bracket, these things only become more and more real.

I know founders who look like they're doing great at managing their relationships, and while I can't say for certain, I would be willing to bet they are investing a lot more into doing so than they would have while pursuing a more stable career.

## We ARE doing great
We insist that despite our low-expenditure lifestyle, we're doing great. Not just the company doing great, as mentioned above, but ourselves, personally. That we're fulfilled, healthy, happy and not stressed or lonely. Through a combination of being actually true and managing to convince ourselves through repetition and insistence that it is, we really are doing great.

## So the answer is...?
As always, this post won't have the answer for you. I think the best way to answer this question is to get a taste for both either through internships or spending a year on each. Most people will feel comfortable and at home soon enough if they're in the right environment. Many of my friends in the startosphere now had spent a reasonable stint in the corporate world either interning or for a while after graduating.
