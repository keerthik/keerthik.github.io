# Real Lessons From Games
<div class="essay-subtext">cross-posted: <a href="https://medium.com/p/97b4e72493ad">on Medium</a></div>

Games as a medium for achieving objectives other than entertainment has gotten a lot of attention recently. It has developed into a big enough space that it is outside the scope of a single post. 

I will likely be writing posts later about games with respect to general intelligence, learning, corporate "gamification", and other modern facets of games outside entertainment.

However, this post is to talk about individual games with specific topical or skill benefits outside gaming. No statistics, studies or anything else. Just the games that I wound up at when I trace back some of my personal development.

Here are three completely different games, from totally distinct eras of video gaming, that have given me value in three fairly unique ways, outside of entertainment.

## Minesweeper
The classic game that pretty much everyone from my generation has played. The biggest thing minesweeper accomplished was cement the mindset that doing math is like solving puzzles, and often solving puzzles is about doing math, and that both of them are fun. 

> Minesweeper made numbers, and by extension much of math, enjoyable to approach, manipulate, hold in my head. Even if I didn't understand some math, I never feared it.

I developed an affinity for staring at incomplete information, trying to reason my way around finding out what was hidden, and determining the right move, all encoded in numbers. Which is essentially what math is. It may not have made me good at math, but it definitely made me enjoy math, and that made life easier in many ways.

Not to mention, when you get deeper into extremely hard Minesweeper challenges, the [logic and probability analysis](http://nothings.org/games/minesweeper/) you end up learning to do only gets more and more intense.

## Age of Empires
Based on historical conquests from around the world, this real-time strategy game series is fondly remembered by everyone who has played it, and is still played by many.

William Wallace, Joan d'Arc, Saladin and his Marmlukes, Carthiginians, Conquistadors -- all names I may have never heard of or read more about if not for this wonderful series. Age of Empires snuck a lot of world cultural and historical knowledge into the depths of my mind, without me paying any attention to it. 

> Playing Age of Empires, I developed an interest in world history, gained some basic knowledge, and had an exciting context to put around any additional knowledge I gained.

Every so often I think about Age of Empires campaigns, and I can't resist going to wikipedia and learning something new about those castles and heroes and wars and missions. World history that our school textbooks didn't even brush against, and one doesn't hear about in casual conversation -- through Age of Empires only.

## X-COM: Enemy Unknown, "hardcore mode"
The newest of these games, and easily one of my favourites of all time. It is also the most obscure of the three, so I'll try to give enough context. X-COM is a long-running squad-based turn-based tactics game. If you're not familiar, think chess with more actions besides "move" and "kill". Enemy Unknown is one of the newest instalments, and it had a deep impact on how I saw the consequence of my actions.

Your squad members each have identifiable names and faces, gain skills and experience the longer they have survived through combat. They not only become more valuable to your cause of winning the game, but you also develop a personal connection with each member. As the commander, you feel like you're nurturing the fresh recruits, and depending on your trusty veterans. And they are so incredibly mortal.

In "hardcore mode", your game is autosaved after every turn, and you cannot load any past save points. Every action you take can have serious consequences. If your skilled lieutanent or captain is killed, he's not coming back. If your squad of fresh recruits gets wiped because you didn't want to bring your veterans, you lose the mission and your men, and there's nothing you can do about it. No retries, no reloads.

And it's amazing. You develop deeper connections with your soldiers. You are genuinely afraid of what might happen next. You truly feel hopeless and powerless when a mission starts to fall apart because of an impatient, risky gamble you made, as your most valuable squad members are crushed one by one.

> A playthrough of X-COM in “hardcore mode” taught me patience, to appreciate the consequence of my actions, and to take responsibility for those actions.

When mission after mission you realize that your brashness and lack of preparation is causing the death of your critical soldiers, you stop blaming the universe and reflect for a bit. And the best part is that you can *clearly* notice that their survival rate improves as you take better care of them. When you play willing to take responsibility, you work harder. You prepare better. You learn to be patient. You make backup plans. You explore your options more carefully.

I did play X-COM only fairly recently. And yes, I would like to think I learned the lesson of taking responsibility for my actions sooner than last year. But it was only after completing X-COM, and reflecting on my experience that I was able to explicitly note that I have learned the life-lesson of taking responsibility for my actions and their consequences.

## Learn from all your games
There’s a lot to talk about the educational value of games. I think one learns a lot better, even if not more, from games that were designed for entertainment rather than for the classroom. One aspect of my gameplaying that I cultivated over the years, was to reflect on my experience when I’m done with a game — figure out what it did for me. Almost every game I play through to the end has done something for me besides entertainment/burn time.

So spend some time reflecting on what you get out of your experiences, and see how they’ve developed you as a person, and what kind of future experiences could provide what you’re looking for!
