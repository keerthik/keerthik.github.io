I have spent much time by myself in several of the places I have been in. During my two-year nomad stint, roughly half the days were spent without speaking on any personal level to another human present in meatspace. In this time I began to treat the place I was in like the companion I was hanging out with when I wasn't being distracted by individual humans. I imagine them as these disembodied conglomerate beings composed of the culture, history, food, language, architecture and weather. They have a distinct personality, tastes, proclivities, opinions and flaws. They can be welcoming, diverse, stoic, rude, creative, hesitant, energetic. This is what I call the place-person.

No doubt, to a great extent the place-person is a manifestation of the hivemind of the people presently there. But in addition it represents those who were there in the past, as well as the friends of the place, past and present.

## Place-people Relationships

As an individual, I realized I can build relationships with place-people. Handling their currency: do they cringe when I pull out cash, or not even bat an eyelid if I try to use Apple Pay? Understanding their traffic expectations, which pertains to but is more than the laws -- how accepted is jaywalking, what is the unspoken hierarchy of the streets? Picking up on the natural layouts of the city blocks -- how often can I expect a convenience store, and what can I expect to find there? What is the distribution of activities and eateries in the vicinity of eminent transit centers? Recognizing, respecting and supporting the ideals and values the place stands for -- be it the arts, marriage equality, traditionalist architecture, cosmetic surgery or embracing new technology. Learning their [language](languageliving.html) -- even if it may seem to use the same words and grammar as the language you spoke before, the local expressions, usage, intonations, insinuations of the words make it an entirely different language that requires attention and care to understand and use as my own. The way the people navigate the city, their gut reactions to various everyday events, the [look in their eyes](eyes.html). I could write entire separate posts about each of those (as I already have for some of these).

As is customary on this topic, I'll be expanding on Paul Graham's essay on [cities and ambition](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html).

Cities mold us as people more than other individuals. The things we overhear is the hivemind conversing with you about what it finds interesting. What we find in the stores is the place describing its lifestyle to you. What jobs the city offers and who the city celebrates whispers in our ears and influences our own ambitions. The looks you get when you do [your personal quirk](whatido.html) in public is how welcoming the city is towards you.

Relationships with place-people are more similar to those with humans than we imagine. As you invest in building the relationship, the place-person treats you better, welcomes you, befriends you.

> Once you and a place-person become true friends, they have become a part of who you are, and you become a part of who they are.

This realization changed the way I interact with places greatly. It's important to me to try and befriend cities I like. And to know if I like them, I need to get to know them. I understood why I derived very limited contentment from doing the tourist circuit -- it was merely the facade the city put on for people who weren't actually interested in becoming friends. Like your party or office facade, sure it's relevant and still a part of you, and often people enjoy interacting with that and don't want to deal with your baggage. But that isn't who you fundamentally would be, if you had the choice. To me, doing no more than eating at the top-rated restaurants, taking selfies with the skyline and buying some souvenirs for friends back home felt a lot like going to a party and raiding the fridge of a host who invited you out of politeness.

## My Friends

I hate the way we talk about places right now. They're treated as static, immutable entities without feelings or personalities. A dot on a map, a certain number of miles or hours away, a tick on "cost of living" and "income range" charts, the source of some specific kind of goods. They're all roughly the same, and seemingly the only explicit reasons we choose one over the country is its basic geographic relationship with our life -- distance from our job, our family, friends, and allowed legal presence where it applies. But real cities bring so much more.

In 2014, merely 3 days into my first visit to Hong Kong, the city broke out in one of the most profound protests of our generation -- the Umbrella Revolution. The movement earned the name as the protesters stood steadfast in their cause withstanding bombardment of teargas from riot police using umbrellas. A simple yet powerful act -- they showed they wouldn't back down, but wouldn't resort to violence or misdemeanour. They did it in a way that was vibrantly visible to anyone looking. The city weeped, yet stood strong. The city fought, yet harmed noone. The police worked with volunteers from the movement to keep bystanders safe. They handed out flyers along the periphery of the protests explaining both sides of the protest, meant for visitors. Rather than gripe about being inconvenienced in moving through the central parts of Hong Kong, I was touched that it shared this trying moment with me, a complete stranger. We got closer. I loved Hong Kong for the values it stood for and how it stood for them. I would drop by for a visit every time I could stop on the way anywhere else.

Ironically, beginning to understand my relationships with cities manifested as a deeper understanding of my human relationships. The reasons why I liked certain kinds of people, the effects they had on me were very similar to those of the cities I liked, and in many ways their personalities too.

So whether you're home, or on vacation, or on a business trip -- take a moment, speak to the place, hear what it has to tell you. You may find a lifelong friend. A friend vastly different from you, who will teach you something new. 

A friend who will remember you long, long after you're gone.
