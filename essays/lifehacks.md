Booking flights, especially for vacations: Book mid week. Book dates that are midweek. Book approximately 3 months ahead of your first leg. If you're on a multicity vacation, try adding an extra major metropolitan city that's along the route, and see if you can make your trip $400 cheaper all of a sudden.
