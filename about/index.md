I develop software where needed, but am mostly figuring out how to evoke a sense of enjoyment through things I make. I care about games, learning, and creation.

## Contact

I am best reached by email. Hit me up at `keerthiko[at]gmail[dot]com`

Cold emails work. I love to meet/mentor people who may be interested in what I know or would like to collaborate. I follow a [maker's schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and prefer in-person, timeboxed to other media.

I also do the twitters: <!--Twitter--><a href="https://twitter.com/qedkorc" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @qedkorc</a>
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

### Geography
I was born in picturesque Thiruvananthapuram, in south India. I grew up in quaint Muscat, Oman. I went to college in Boston, then moved to the bay area as employee #1 of BitGym, which I ended being a cofounder of through a major pivot.

I was forced to be a digital nomad [December 2013 - August 2015](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zQyPQn7ohRmA.kUSGhXjsO2xM) due to the wonderful machinations of US immigration -- I lived out of {{ site.abnb }} listings around Asia while I mostly wrote code as a cofounder through bouts of depression.

After wrangling an O1 and eventually a green card I was based in SF city [2015 - 2019], but find myself outside the country about a third of the year by choice.


## This site

This site primarily hosts descriptions of my [projects](/projects) and [writing](/essays). I am a fledgling writer, so bear with me. Occasionally I test out web app ideas here.

### History

The previous iteration was made while learning Ruby on Rails. The one before that was made while learning basic web technologies, HTML, CSS, js, etc. Now that I've learned those things, I have decided a static page is best for personal sites. This time [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} is my weapon of choice, and I happily vouch for it.

I started working on this in Thailand, on April 22nd 2014.

There was a [pretty chill coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat){:target="_blank"} going on here at the time of this writing (May/June 2014).
