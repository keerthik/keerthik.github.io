# keerthik: fun-lover, entreprenuer, lifehacker

I develop software where needed, but am mostly figuring out how to evoke a sense of enjoyment through things I make. I care about games, learning, and creation.

### Tools You Can Use

### Geography
I was born in picturesque Thiruvananthapuram, in south India. I grew up in quaint Muscat, Oman. I went to college in Boston, then cofounded a company in the Bay Area. 

I was a digital nomad [December 2013 - August 2015](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zQyPQn7ohRmA.kUSGhXjsO2xM) -- I lived out of [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/komanakuttan?s=8) listings around the world while I mostly wrote code.

# History

The previous iteration was made while learning Ruby on Rails. The one before that was made while learning basic web technologies, HTML, CSS, js, etc. Now that I've learned those things, I have decided a static page is best for personal sites. This time [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} is my weapon of choice, and I happily vouch for it. 

I started working on this in Thailand, on April 22nd 2014.

There was a [pretty chill coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat){:target="_blank"} going on here at the time of this writing (May/June 2014).
