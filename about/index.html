<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	This page will shortly be merged with the portfolio page to describe me.
</p>
<p>
	If this were 2005 I would be considered a software developer, since that's what people tend to offer me jobs for. However with the blurred lines of a career today, I merely call myself fun-maker. I develop software where needed, but am mostly figuring out how to evoke a sense of enjoyment in my audience.
</p>
<h3>Working on</h3>
<ul>
	<li>{{ site.bg }} - cofounder, android lead, experience designer</li>
	<li>{{ site.zk }} - half of everything</li>
	<li>{{ site.ds }} - creator, game design lead, marketing lead</li>
	<li>this site - author</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where you can (try to) find me</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.github.com/keerthik">github</a>: not pushing anything public nowadays</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/qedkorc">twitch</a>: not streaming nowadays</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/keerthiko">twitter</a>: not tweeting</li>
	<li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005341368/">steam</a>: just playing</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So your best bet is probably to just google/social-media stalk/email me if you want to get in touch. Find those out on your own ;)
</p>
<h2>This site</h2>
<p>
	This site is primarily a personally maintained repository of my <a href="/essays">thoughts and writing</a>. I am a fledgling essay author. I also use it to test and toy with web app ideas.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
	The previous iteration was made while learning Ruby on Rails. The one before that was made while learning basic web technologies, HTML, CSS, js, etc. Now that I've learned those things, I have decided a static page is best for personal sites. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> is my weapon of choice, and I happily vouch for it.
</p>
<p>
	I started working on this in Thailand, on April 22nd 2014. <br>There was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">pretty chill coup</a> going on here at the time of this writing (May/June 2014).
