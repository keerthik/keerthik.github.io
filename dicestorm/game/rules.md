[Unit Cards (Epic)](units_epic.html)

Dicestorm is an fantasy/sci-fi 1v1 tactics game combining dexterity and strategy.

# Win Condition
The last side to have live units remaining on the board once the deployment rounds are over wins.

# Game Parameters
## Army supply cap
Total units that will be deployed for each player
Recommended: 9; Advanced: 12
## Active supply cap
Max number of units active on the board
Recommended: 5; Advanced: 7
## Deploy cap
Max units that may be deployed when free Active supply is available
Recommended: 2; Advanced: 3

# Game Setup
The two players sit directly across from each other. Each player picks one of the playable factions (currently: Orbotrons or Hellspawn) and collects all the corresponding unit tokens to their side of the play area. Set up the hex-grid board with the long-side facing each player. Place tokens face down in a stack on your side of the table matching the army supply cap.

# Round Structure
The game happens in rounds lasting about 4-8 minutes each. The game lasts a minimum of 5 rounds, and typically up to about 6 or 7.

Each round is composed of up to 3 phases: Deploy, Tactical, Bombardment (or Ranged).

## Deploy
In this phase both players bring units onto the board and into play while they have remaining army supply and free active supply. Once a player has depleted their army supply, they no longer participate in the Deploy phase.

### Deploy Initiative
Deploy initiative is given to player with fewer units on the board. When tied, such as at the start of the game, both players roll D20s, and whoever rolls a higher value will begin the phase.

### Mechanics
The row closest to the player is the default deployment zone. Some unit abilities may provide additional deploy zones.
Both players select Base Units of their choice and removes the same number of tokens from their army supply. The player with initiative places all of them face-down on valid deployment zones, followed by the other player. The first player flips all his units face-up, followed by the other player.

Any "upon deployment" triggered abilities are triggered now. Once completed, move into the Tactical phase.

For more epic games the active supply cap, army supply cap and deploy cap can be adjusted to be higher (7, 12 and 3)

## Tactics
This phase immediately follows the Deploy phase in the first 3 rounds, and is the first phase in subsequent rounds. In this phase both players will take turns moving deployed units around the board and utilizing their unique abilities.

### Tactical Initiative
Deploy initiative carries over to the Tactics phase*, i.e., the player who placed units first during the Deploy phase will make the first move in the Tactical phase.

### Mechanics
Place a single turn token on each unit in play and on artifacts that receive turn tokens. Any "start of Tactics" triggered abilities are triggered now.

The player with initiative gets to take a turn with a single piece that has a turn token on it. Take the turn token off the unit once it has been moved. The other player now takes his turn. Both players take turns using single turn tokens until one side has exhausted all their turn tokens. The other player gets to finish up.

### Taking a turn
Each unit with a turn token may move followed by using an Active Ability. Using the Active Ability ends that unit's turn, consuming its turn token. Unless specified otherwise, a unit may no longer move or take any actions after using an Active Ability.

Units that can move are assigned a "Move" score. This is how many hexes it may move. Movement may happen in any direction and units can change direction mid-movement. You may not path through or over occupied hexes unless specified otherwise.

You may skip a turn simply by removing a unit's turn token, passing play to your opponent.

Once all turn tokens have been spent, move into the Bombardment/Ranged phase.

### Abilities
If a unit has more than one Active Ability, only one may be used with a turn token. Using an ability before completing the maximum move will void any unused movement unless specified otherwise. If a unit dies as a result of an ability, trigger any "upon death" abilities.

A Passive Ability may be triggered any time the conditions are fulfilled even if the unit does not have a turn token.

## Bombardment
This phase follows the Tactical phase. In this phase both players will bombard their enemy with dice and utilize abilities that are related to these dice.

### Bombardment Initiative
Bombardment initiative is given to the player with more units on the board. When tied, such as at the start of the game, both players roll D20s, and whoever rolls a higher value will begin the phase.

NOTE: There is a slight advantage to playing *second* in the Bombardment phase, the opposite of the Tactics phase.

### Mechanics
For each unit in play, each player may collect the corresponding dice. Any Ranged abilities that provide dice to launch may be triggered now, paying any appropriate prices immediately. Each ranged ability may be used only once by a unit in a single Bombardment phase unless specified otherwise.

The player with initiative will throw all their dice onto the board, with the aim of damaging the units in play. Note that all Bombardment damage is capable of "friendly fire", i.e., they do damage to units regardless of who threw the dice and who owns each unit.

Minimum throw range is 3‚Äù from the edge of the board, i.e., the player must release the die before their hand is any closer than 3" from the board.

* D6, D20 do face-value damage to a unit within the hex they land in.
* D8, D12 do face-value damage to units within the hex they land in, and half damage rounded down in all adjacent hexes, to a minimum of 1 damage.
* D12s can be re-thrown once, immediately after they have been thrown (before any other dice have been thrown).

Once both players have thrown all dice, the player with initiative may trigger ranged "reaction" abilities. These are abilities that affect "landed dice". Then the other player may do the same. Once all reactions are complete, damage is resolved. Trigger any "after damage evaluation" and "upon death" abilities here if appropriate.

# Pieces
Any hex card placed on the board is a "piece". They occupy space and block pathing.

Deployed pieces and Titan pieces are creatures, and receive turn tokens.

Artifacts are pieces that have special properties. They may or may not receive turn tokens. They do not count towards initiative calculations or the victory condition.

Abilities may selectively affect only allied, enemy or both, and creatures, artifacts or pieces (both).

Pieces receive turn tokens only at the start of the Tactics phase unless mentioned otherwise.

Summoned and deployed pieces receive max hp unless mentioned explicitly.
Pieces cannot be healed beyond their max hp.
