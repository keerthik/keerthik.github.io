**-- Start of Round --**
## Initiative
- Whoever has fewer active units chooses initiative
- When both players are even, roll d20. Higher gets to choose initiative
- Player given initiative acts first in every phase for the round

## Phases 1: Deployment

## Phase 2: <span class="active">Tactics</span>
- Place turn tokens on units and relevant artifacts
- Trigger all "start of tactics" ability effects in initiative order
- Take a turn using a single turn token, starting with initiative player
	- May move up to maximum movement for that unit
	- May use an <span class="active">active ability</span> (may not move after acting unless specified)
	- Remove turn token
- Alternate turns until one player is out of tokens. Other player finishes using all tokens
