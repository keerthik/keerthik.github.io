# Operation Dicestorm

Tactical board game for the new generation of gamers

[Learn more](/dicestorm/game) about the game.

# Team

## Philip Chung
Gameplay engineer, makes things

Sands, saws, lasercuts and more. Besides bringing the game to life, also keeps Keerthik in check so that his mechanics actually make sense and are balanced.

## Keerthik Omanakuttan
Gameplay designer, fun-nut

Thinks constantly about every aspect of the game to make it as fun as possible. Also does random stuff like create the website, write design blog entries, carry his prototype around the world to playtest wherever he travels, and pester people to like the {{ site.ds }} facebook page.

Countless other people have helped us along the way, including:
Colden, Chen, Andy B, Alison, and every single person who playtested with us.
