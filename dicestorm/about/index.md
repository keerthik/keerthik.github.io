# Operation Dicestorm

Tactical board game for the new generation of gamers

## Tactical Trinity
The intense combat of dicestorm is a battle of wits (intelligence), physical skill (dexterity) and chance (fortune). Are you the kind of commander who uses his skill on the battlefield to defeat the enemy with a frontal assault? Or your keen tactical sense, capitalizing on the smallest opportunity? Perhaps the Gods of war will tilt the tides in your favour on the back of your well-balanced approach?

## Asymmetric Factions
Inspired by games like Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft and the Command & Conquer series, Dicestorm features fully unique factions, with diverse units, options, and strategies. Pick the faction that suits your personality adn style.

# Team


## Philip Chung
Gameplay engineer, makes things

Sands, saws, lasercuts and more. Besides bringing the game to life, also keeps Keerthik in check so that his mechanics actually make sense and are balanced.

## Keerthik Omanakuttan
Gameplay designer, fun-nut

Thinks constantly about every aspect of the game to make it as fun as possible. Also does random stuff like create the website, write design blog entries, carry his prototype around the world to playtest wherever he travels, and pester people to like the {{ site.ds }} facebook page.

Countless other people have helped us along the way, including:
Colden, Chen, Andy B, Alison, and every single person who playtested with us.
