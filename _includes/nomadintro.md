*In December 2013, I left San Francisco to begin my life as a digital nomad. I live out of [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/komanakuttan?s=8) listings, mostly in Asia, while I continue to work remotely for my startup, [BitGym](http://www.bitgym.com).*

*When I happen to be in a deserted town or donâ€™t go out much, I lose a sense of drive and purpose. I slowly regress to my base level of motivation, inspiration and happiness. Being in a bustling city usually boosts this for me. The right city is exhilarating, like riding a rocketship.*
