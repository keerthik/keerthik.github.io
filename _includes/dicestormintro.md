*{{ site.ds }} is my pet side project. Dicestorm is a 1 versus 1 tactical strategy game, where the armies of completely asymmetric factions duke it out till only one has units standing. In the spirit of Blizzard RTS games like StarCraft and WarCraft, we prioritized making each unit type feel completely unique, yet comparably powerful in the grand scheme of things. While this makes for a lot of variety in the gameplay, it is extremely challenging to manage complexity, balance and a variety of other design considerations. 

When I meet other board gamers, I generally get them to play a round with me observing their reactions and expressions to each aspect that comes into play as the game goes on.*
