<!--
This is a hex-grid based puzzle version of popular
number game "2048" or "threes" or "1024".
It combines progress with exploration, in this 
implementation creating small personal rewards
for the player based on how far they get.

Mechanics:
The concept is to combine like numbers by having them
collide against the edge of the playable region. The
objective is to build the largest possible number before
the grid fills up preventing you from taking any actions
(game over)
When you reach a number that glows, moving it into the center
will unlock a reward.

Control Scheme:
Being a hex grid means there are 6 cardinal directions
instead of 4. To maintain control scheme simplicity,
only 2 of these directions are used, and we introduce
rotational flexibility instead, using up or down to rotate
the entire grid clockwise or counterclockwise.

Design:
Freeze stuff when reward is live
